Excellent 	2
Have been a patient of Dr Schwarz for 2 years and have never been disappointed with her bedside manner. She is extremely thorough and efficient. Dr. Schwarz takes as much time as needed to listen to all of your concerns. She is easy to talk to and is genuinely interested in what you have to say. I would definitely recommend her to everyone.	2
Doctor Schwarz is a wonderful physician! She is very caring ,understanding and very knowledgeable about family medicine. If there’s emergency and you leave her a message she’ll give you a call back and she is very very concerned about the reason for your call. Overall,if you care about your health and you want to physican that cares about you , you should definitely become a patient.	2
She takes the time to listen.	1
She has your back and REALLLLLY cares!  I finally found my forever Primary Care Physician!	2
A very compassionate doctor. Staff and office help are also very friendly and helpful.  She treats patients with concern as if you were a friend or family member	2

I'm very happy with Dr. Schwarz...didn't wait long for her....Dr Schwarz took her time with me very compassionate seemed to really care.  Love the Essex  Street office, easy to get too... easy parking everyone seemed friendly...Can make appointments online... I'll be back	2
"I had the same PCP for at 15 years, when my doctor moved to a different State,, I had no choice but to change my PCP. I searched for months to find a doctor that accepts my insurance and of course well recommended. Someone told me about Dr. Schwarz, 
Little did I know I picked the right doctor, after I made my first appointment I was more than a 100% satisfied, so I made an appointment for my oldest child and my husband. Waiting time always exist no matter where you go, so that doesn’t bother me"	2
The Best doctor and the VERY BEST human being that I have ever seen, My family is being bless to have her as our doctor !!!	2
Great bedside manner 	2
She disregarded me when I arrived for an appointment, canceled it on the spot without even seeing me first, claiming she couldn't help me with my condition, that i needed to be seen by another doctor. when all i needed was a script for some antibiotics and some advice and guidance. After years of being my PCP it was disappointing to be treated this way. 	0

"Dr. Hussain was very professional. He spent a lot of time with me discussing my care. He is very caring and I am happy to have found him as my primary care physician!	"	2
It has always been very difficult for me to find a PCP I actually trus and feel comfortable with.She was so kind and understanding and extremely thorough. I could not be happier. The staff in the office were also very kind and understanding as I am terrified of needles. It was a wonderful experience. THANK YOU	2
Dr.Uliano is absolutely the best doctor I’ve seen to date. I can start by saying I don’t usually visit primary doctors unless absolutely needed (which was the case this time) because I feel Most doctors do a half way job when going for a physical or any health concern. Dr.Uliano was extremely thorough, I mean she checked things on me I didn’t know existed. She’s extremely knowledgeable with exquisite bedside manner. She leaves with a sense of trust in her and I’ll  never visit another doctor! 	2
i was extremely impressed and happy I came here. The front desk was happy and helpful. I was nervous because i feel most Doctors don't take them time but Dr. Uliano and her staff did. They asked questions and gave me the things I needed to get to the next step. 	2
Very kind and thorough 	2
Seeing Dr. Uliano was a pleasure. She is a caring and intelligent doctor.  The whole office staff was amazing as well.	2
Came here for the first time after I found her on ZocDoc. The staff was very caring and on top of their things. They were respectful and knew wha they were doing. When I came I got seen right away. The doctor her self is very caring and actually understands everytbing you’re not trying to say. It felt like family. I really recommend this doctor to anyone who is looking for one. 	2
She was very kind. Put me at ease and told me what would take care of my issue. Glad to found my new pcp. 	2
Easy to talk to, spends time with you, conscientious, and asks probing questions to determine the cause of your illness.   	2
I needed a new primary care doctor and recently visited Dr. Uliano for an annual physical. She is very nice and took her time with me during my appointment - very thorough! So happy I finally found a doctor I feel comfortable with!	2
This has been one of the best and most informative  doctors visits that i have ever been to. After endless doctors and almost losing hope, i would have to say my faith is restored. She took the time to listen and knew what to do. Thank you very much!!!!!	2
The most thorough exam, including a breast exam. I highly recommend Dr. Uliano 	2
I went into Dr. Uliano's office thinking I hurt my calf working out.  I am a 50 year old male in good shape and thought it was some type of ligament or muscle problem in my lower leg.  Dr. Uliano said he wanted to rule out a DVT (blood clot) and sent me for a sonogram.  This was done on a Saturday and she sent me to a testing lab that took me right away.  To my surprise, they diagnosed a blood clot.  I had to go to the ER and was treated.  Her diagnosis helped me avoid a serious problem. 	1
Glad I found my PCP! She was very thorough and listened to all of my concerns. I will definitely be recommending her to my family and friends. 	2
Haven sent!!!! Dr. Uliano is a well experienced, competent, beyond carrying, thorough, brilliant Doctor, I cant find enough good words to describe how amazing she is. She is a primary care Dr. that all Dr. should be like. From making follow-up phone calls even when she's not at the office to see if you are okay. To making the appointments for you to whom ever she refer you to. even the specialist that she suggested are wonderful Doctors. Don't even question it just book the appointment!!!!	2
Dr, Uliano is friendly, caring, and thorough. Cares about you, not just a number..My who;e family will be changing to now come to see her.	2
She is a very nice doctor, excellent bedside manner! She was very thorough with her examination and explaining things. 	2
Dr. Uliano is very thorough, professional and caring. She was very hands on. She was very knowledgeable about my condition and was able to help me by providing excellent care. 	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Uliano. She’s very informing and really care for her patients. 	2
She is a great doctor 	2
"Dr. Nishat is the most attentive doctor I have come to know.  She follows up weather it be via text, phone call and/or written notice.  Her knowledge in the medical field is vast.  I only wish I had her as my primary physician since I moved to Yonkers, 20 yrs ago.  She communicates well and has educated me in all my health matters.  She has such a pleasant and gracefully way about herself.  I would recommend Dr. Nishat 100% knowing she will help others to the best of her abilities.
Thank you VM."	2
Dr. Nishat is a very caring and understanding and brilliant doctor! She has taken great care of my entire family. Her interpersonal skills are incomparable! Recommend her to absolutely everyone. 	2
Very patient and understanding. It is easy to talk to her and explain. Dr Nishat is very well qualified and  has sound judgement.	2
Highly recommend Dr Nishat to everyone. Very helpful and caring doctor.  	2
So kind, understanding and very professional 	2
  Dr. A Nishat has great professional and bed side manners. She listen to you and tries to work with you .  Dr. Nishat is a great doctor I will recommend her to everyone 	2
Dr Nishat was very thorough, kind, and knowledgable when I visit her about a painful infection last month. I highly recommend her if you are looking for a smart doctor with excellent interpersonal skills.	2
Dr. Nishat is such a wonderful physician. She really takes her time with you and answers all of your questions. She's really patient and thorough. 	2
Finding Dr. Nishat has been a blessing. She has gone above and beyond to take care of me physically & emotionally.. .. I don't know what I would have done without her over these past difficult few months.  She is kind & compassionate and most importantly she really listens . I've been to many doctors over the years and honestly she is one of the best 	2
I highly recommend dr. Arshia to family and friend... Excellent knowledge, gentle behaviour and best explanation ..... I am greatly satisfied the way she carry her work in a professional way  	2
I have been using Dr Smith and his father before him for almost 40 years. I have complete confidence in his care. The staff is also wonderful and many of them have been with the office for years. If anyone is looking for a family medicine doctor Dr Smith would be my first recommendation	2
Love, love, love Dr Smith!   He is a very thorough, knowledgeable and caring physician.   He and his staff are just wonderful.   Especially Gwynn!   I love that he brings his dog Sabrina in on Wednesday’s as she is so sweet.  I make all my appointments on Wednesdays.  I can’t say enough and I would highly recommend him.   Linda Rein	2
Dr. Smith is one of the best doctors I have seen. I left my last Dr. Because he did not seem to actually listen to me or my concerns. Dr. Smith listens to everything that I have a concern about and addresses the most important first weather I need bloodwork or MRI and will listen to the rest of the issues. He will recommend a specialist if I seem to have a problem beyond his knowledge. He is honest and very personable. I really like him and his staff is wonderful as well.	2
He is the best!!	2
Dr. Parrotta is one of the best doctors I’ve ever been to! He is extremely knowledgeable, takes his time to listen to you, makes you feel comfortable and always thoroughly explains everything to you. You can tell he truely cares about his patients. Can’t recommend him enough 	2
"Dr Parrotta was very attentive and accommodating to all of my needs. He seems very knowledgeable and confident and made me feel comfortable.  I will definitely be returning to him. 
"	2
Terrible  experience with Hey Doctor unsympathetic and unprofessional	0
Best healthcare experience I've ever had. I live in rural Montana where I have to drive 1.5 hours to a different town see my PCP (who also takes months to get into). HeyDoctor responded in less than 10 mins. It saved me so much time, money and hassle--but best of all, Dr. Levy is super knowledgeable and truly took the time to consider my symptoms and the best course of action. It was a perfect mix of convenient remote technology with genuine human care. Stoked to have found such a great option! 	2
"Completely amazing. Between the time, I opened the web page, until getting a text from the pharmacy that the prescription was ready was 24 minutes. Total cost for was $15!! 
The speed and convenience and friendless is just something out of this world. 
To get this done by normal means without insurance would of been a 3 week wait to get in to my dr, and a 2-3 hour wait to see him, and then $150 for them to say here you go. Healthcare in the US is BROKE, I am so glad this service exists!"	2
I started seeing Dr. Elmaleh in the summer of 2018 after encountering a host of health issues that were slowly becoming more severe as time went on. Before turning to Dr. Elmaleh, I sought the help of several doctors – including a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist – due to digestive problems, food intolerances, flatulence, cystic acne, panic attacks, severe fatigue, sleep problems, and lack of energy. I was at my wits’ end when I made my appointment with her, but I instantly knew that I was in the right hands the moment I walked into her office. I began to see a marked improvement in my health, especially with my digestion, a month into starting the homeopathic remedies she prescribed. A year later, I feel like myself again and credit Dr. Elmelah for helping me regain my health.  If you’d like to regain your health using a holistic approach and would like to work with a practitioner that’s knowledgeable and caring, Dr. Elmaleh is the person to go to without a doubt.	2
Dr. Elmaleh is a wonderful, caring and thorough doctor, who has helped me tremendously.  I came to her when no one else could help me and have been healthy ever since. 	2
Dr. Elmaleh has been my doctor for almost 25 years. She is most caring and most competent. She gives you so much time and listens. She has helped me when no other doctor was able to do so. I highly recommend her. Thanks.	2
Dr. Elmaleh has been my doctor for over 10 years. She is one of the most genuine and caring doctors ever! She is passionate about her work and in her quest to help each of her patient. Her holistic approach is refreshing. I highly recommend her! 	2
"Dr. Elmaleh has been truly life-saving for me as a practitioner. I have experienced chronic health issues for the majority of my life, but until meeting Dr. Elmaleh, I was never taken seriously -- nor was I offered any viable solutions aside from harmful pharmaceuticals. Her dedication to healing and putting together the puzzle pieces of a complicated medical situation is evident in each appointment we have. Furthermore, she has given me the confidence to deidentify as a ""sick"" person as I take back control of my body/health through her knowledge of homeopathy and supplements. Thank you, Dr. Elmaleh!"	2
Dr Elmaleh is a highly qualified physician who takes the time to listen to her patients with compassion and intelligent inquiry. 	2
As a transplant to New York from Europe, where I had been in the care of a Physician/Homeopath, I feel lucky to have found Dr. Elmaleh.  She, too, combines these two practices seamlessly.  As an attentive listener, she establishes a thorough medical/personal  history, asks relevant questions and establishes a sound plan of care.  It feels good to have Dr. Elmaleh as my trusted ally in keeping me on my path of good health.	2
"I am seeing Dr. Elmaleh for over a year now. Dr. Elmaleh is a dedicated, compassionate, skilled homeopath. I was amazed at the almost instant improvement I  felt after my first visit; the homeopathy making a significant difference in my life. 
And over time I still continue to experience improvement.  DR Elmaleh has made a significant difference in my life. "	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Elmaleh’s for many years. I attribute to her care my ability to to maintain excellent health without having to resort to any pharmaceuticals. Any health issues I have encountered have been resolved through her prescriptions for homeopathic remedies as well as vitamins and herbal supplements. Her wise and thoughtful advice invariably enhance my sense of well-being. I always leave her office feeling happy and well-cared for. 	2
I was diagnosed last year with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The conventional treatment for NTM is two years of antibiotics. After taking antibiotics for two years, there is over a 50% chance that that the NTM will return. I started searching for alternative treatments. When I first met with Dr. Elmaleh last November, I was very sick with NTM and severe colitis. I started homeopathic treatments  in November. I feel like a different person today. Dr. Elmaleh changed my life. 	2
Dr. Elmaleh has been treating my daughter for several years.  While many specialists we worked with were keen to prescribe and send us on our way, Dr. Elmaleh took the time to get to know my daughter and really work with us to get to the root of her allergies.  Since we began work with Dr. Elmaleh, we have been able to cut out so many of the drugs prescribed to her by others.  Her allergies and asthma have improved and she healthy and happy.  Dr. Elmaleh changed our lives, and we are so thankful	2
"Dr. Elmaleh is a true holistic practitioner.  She has her medical training in internal medicine and is also a world-class homeopath.  She blends these approaches seamlessly, combining the best of western medicine with the healing practices of homeopathy to create an invaluable approach to patient care.

Dr. Elmaleh is super smart, insightful and caring.  She is generous with her time and is easy to be with and trust. As a bonus, her administrative staff is excellent in all ways.
"	2
I have known Dr. E. for 25+ years. I first went to her for my youngest son’s chronic ear infections, which were so bad at age 1 1/2 that he was close to having tubes put. Dr. Elmaleh cured him completely in just a few months. Recently, I consulted her for help with sleep problems; my sleep has gotten a lot better as a result of her treatment. She also figured out why my blood pressure was high and helped me discontinue blood pressure medication. She is a deeply caring and competent doctor.	2
Dr. Elmaleh is a caring professional, extremely knowledgeable in her field, and just an overall wonderful person. She’s seen us through 2 non-medicated, vaginal childbirths; after-birth physical, mental, and emotional concerns; baby problems like colic and allergies; digestive issues; skin problems; hormonal imbalances; colds and flu (which we never had since having her as our doctor); and a lot more.	2
After struggling for most of my life with digestive issues, IBS, depression and fatigue, I came to Dr. Elmaleh in 2002. I sought out homeopathy as an alternative and/or compliment to conventional western medicine because I was not getting answers or relief from my symptoms. I’ve been seeing Dr. Elmaleh for 14 years. She evaluates you as a whole person by considering your physical as well as emotional state when prescribing remedies. She is compassionate, caring and dedicated to her patients. 	2
Dr. Elmaleh is thorough, holistic, and very caring.  She has helped my family with Eczema, anxiety, chronic coughs, skin issues. 	2
Dr. Elmaleh is  extremely knowledgeable in the proper diagnosis and in subscribing the appropriate homeopathic remedies to bring the body into balance.  I began seeing Dr. Elmaleh over 18 years ago while suffering from chronic asthma and issues related to menopause such as heart arrhythmias, digestive problems, mood swings etc. Within three months my asthma disappeared completely, digestive issues subsided, and mood swings and nervousness seized.  She is a very compassionate and caring person.	0
"My experience with Dr. Elmaleh over the past 30 years has been excellent.
I've referred friends, family and my own psychotherapy patients to her."	2
Dr. Elmaleh is extremely competent and experienced - her sage recommendations have helped me with all kinds of medical issues. She very intensely focuses on every aspect of a patient's health and considers everything about you. She is clearly extemely intelligent and brings to bear all of her impressive intellect on your most niggling problems.	2
She's wonderful. Because of her, I delivered 2 babies on their due dates, without medications/epidurals, and with relatively smooth labors! She's treated everything from rashes, to colds, to anxiety and insomnia. She's a wealth of knowledge both of homeopathy but also of life. Sometimes its like going to a therapist! 	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Escobar since he was at Patient's First many years ago.  I am sorry to say that the level of care and concern for his patients has drastically decreased. These positive reviews are from those days when he was at another location. His current affiliation is with NYU. He doesn't call anymore to discuss your results from your test.  He just put me on medicine without explaining anything via NYU online website. I am very disappointed. 	0
"Dr. Escobar is just an amazing doctor! He is a great listener and answered all my 100 health questions I had. :)  I really like that he didn't rush my visit, and took time. 

Dr. Escobar was detailed with in examination. He explained me everything I needed to know and recommended a great specialist for further tests.  I'm really happy I've found him.

His stuff was also very friendly and wonderful. Highly recommended!"	2
Best doctor ever 	2
Dr. Escobar was my doctor for about 6 years while I lived in New York. I now live in Colorado but I have to say Dr. Escobar is absolutely irreplaceable. He always took the time to understand my concerns & when I told him I was getting headaches, he insisted I get an MRI. which I ignored. He called me at home and insisted I go in for the MRI. I went and they found I had a brain bleed. If not for him I would probably have died. God Bless Dr. Hermann Escobar.	2
Although I live in Colorado for 3 years now Dr. Escobar treated me for about 6 years when I lived in New York. I don't think I will ever get the wonderful care that I received from Dr. Escobar. He always took the time to understand what was going on with me and made me feel better even on my worst days. It was always comforting to know that I had his support. His assistant Raquel was always friendly and efficient. We need more medical professionals like Dr. Hermann Escobar.	2
He is a very sincere and caring individual who takes all the time you need with him.  I have been with Dr. Escobar for over 15 years and would never leave.	2
He has been my Dr for 32 years.  He’s been extremely accurate in diagnoses.  He genuinely cares about his patients and talks to my specialists regularly.  He answers questions honestly and never feels any question is silly.  He also listens to you when you tell him your symptoms.  I would never see anyone else.  He’s the best of the best, which is why he’s listed almost yearly in Top Docs in Philadelphia Magazine!	2
Could not imagine leaving the practice of Dr Matthews. His care and concern is genuine. When I am in need of care......,as soon as the door closes......,it is as if I am the only patient in the practice. That gives peace of mind and the knowledge my concerns and needs are being listened too , completlely.  	2
Dr. Matthews caught my attention when I was visiting my friend's mother, a patient of his in the later stage of cancer. He took the time to call to check on her to see how she was doing. His sincerity and compassion is what drew me to him and what's kept me as a patient for the past 25 years.	2
Smart, caring, and compassionate	2
Dr Rachel Bregman is a wonderful doctor!  I saw her for a recent physical and she was thorough, kind, and compassionate	2
Dr Bregman is a great doctor and is kind and caring	2
Rachel Bregman is a great doctor!	2
Dr Bregman has been my doctor more more than 5 years and I have only great things to say about her-  she's kind, attentive, informative and always puts me at ease.	2
I'm still new to this neighborhood and was lucky enough to find Dr Bregman and Westside Family Medicine. My primary care visit took care of everything I needed and I am happy with the care I received!	2
Dr Bregman has seen me in all 3 of her office locations.  All of the offices are convenient and I like being able to see a doctor whenever I need to.  	2
I have been going here for over a decade and I love Dr Bregman and the other providers at WFM.  I went in for a prescription refill and was seen quickly recently.	2
Dr. Rachel Bregman is incredible.  She immediately inspires confidence and made me feel completely at easy.  Her diagnosis was really great and her treatment perfect.  I highly recommend her.	2
Doctor is very good, but Denise and Mary seems to have an attitude problem when you call there for help. I would not recommend them to anyone	0
Love Dr. Malamud, I was a hot mess 28 years ago when I started going to Dr Malamud.   I was referred to Dr Malamud by a baby sitter  I had for my son.  Jackie the  sittere and I were talking and was saying i need a new doctor for my family mainly my son.  Jackie recommend Dr Malamud.   We have been with Dr Malamud now for 28 year. He’s caring like family and sympathetic and listens to my health concerns. 	2
I have been seeing Dr. Malamud for over 25 years. He is caring yet frank, and willing to keep looking for answers when the problem isn't easily resolved. I believe he really cares about me as a person. Over the years he has gone out of his way to help me through the worst of times, and smiled with me during happier times. I find his staff helpful and accommodating. I never have trouble getting an appointment and phone calls are always returned. I don't want him to ever retire!	2
Not that great of a place I been having problems with easy things like paper work and meds. I would not recommend to family or friends, And this has been my physician for 15 years. (sad face) 	0
I have been with Dr. Malamud for around 30 years.  I have found him to be very personable and easy to talk with.  Dr. Malamud never seems to be a rush, and will always take the time to understand and explain your situation.  He has been a great help to my family's overall and wellness.  	2
Always feel super comfortable here. The whole staff makes you feel like family. I wouldnt trust anyone else!!	2
We have used this office and Doctor Malamud for years and are grateful for his excellence in diagnostics and care given to his patients.	2
The best Doctor I have ever met. He has it all. The excellent bedside manners, the intelligence of a Doctor that graduated from the top. I feel so fortunate to have met an empathetic, passionate, and highly skilled Doctor like him.	2
Best family doctor I've had. Personable, thorough, and great bedside manner. 	2
Excellent doctor who listens to your needs.	2
Very personable and great with both of my kids! Ask both about lifestyle and physical health. Attentive when kids are sick	2
Dr. Beddis is thorough. Takes his time. Considers options before recommending treatment. Respects my input and collaborates. Consistently follows up. Has a sense of humor.	2
Awesome Doctor! So very happy to be one of his patients!	2
Dr Beddis is always warm and professional when seeing me for physicals and general visits. Always recommends many options for me to approach the best direction for my general care	2
"Dr. Beddis is a great doctor who stands apart from doctor's I've had. He does not jump to prescribe you medicine and get you out the door. Instead he evaluates your condition thoughtfully and creates a plan.

He was very helpful to me after giving birth when I did not feel supported by my OB.

I recommend him to everyone and know my family and I are in good hands."	2
I've been seeing Dr. Beddis for a few years now and cannot say enough good things about him. He presents things in a concise and understandable manner and his attitude makes you feel comfortable to be in his office.	2
Been with Dr Beddis for about 4 years now and he is always friendly, and professional. He is great at what he does. I fully support and trust his treatment plan for me. Highly recommended.	2
GREAT DOCTOR. ALTHOUGH I WAS ONLY THERE FOR MY INITIAL VISIT AND IT DIDN'T LAST THAT LONG HE WAS GREAT AT MAKING ME FEEL COMFORTABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME OF US MEETING. VERY HELPFUL WITH OFFERING AT HOME TIPS TO KEEP UP WITH MY HEALTH. WOULD HIM RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING TO BE SEEN AT THAT OFFICE. 	2
Dr. Beddis is very personable, easy to converse with and reassuring in discussing your medical condition.	2
I have been seeing Dr. Beddis for a few years now. I can honestly say he is the best physician I have ever been to. He truly shows great quality patient care and he always keeps the patients best interest in mind. He is also always very quick about responding to any questions or concerns. He has truly been amazing and I would recommend him to anyone! 	2
As a physician, I pride myself on making sure my patients feel heard. I understand the mind-body connection and the futility of attempting to treating one without treating the other.  I approach every patient as if they were family.  I am very pleased to say that during my visit today Dr Beddis followed those same tenets. He and I both know that by following those principles in our practice, neither of us will ever win an award for being the fastest in our group. And that is the best compliment.	2
Dr. Beddis is equal parts compassionate and efficient. I was very impressed with the quality of our appointment.	2
Very empathetic and caring. He took the time to truly listen.	2
Great doctor, very helpful	2
"I found Dr.Beddis to be very good and effiencent. made sure all my needs were met

Dr. Beddis listened to my description of the symptoms, and asked appropriate questions to quickly identify the most likely diagnosis of the problem. He took time to explain what the issue was, how he came to the conclusion, what the cause was, and methods to address it. It was a very effective visit.	2
Very kind and listened to what I had to say. Well knowledgeable when answering my questions.	2
"Dr. Beddis is an excellent doctor. Communicates well, genuinely cares about your progress (or lack thereof) and is open to trying just about anything** so long as it produces a positive result.

** obviously within reason, don't expect a prescription for moon beams."	2
I thought he was different but I was wrong. He acted like he was listening to me and heard my concerns but turns out he wasn't. Typical doctor. Only cares about easy money. Doesn't comprehend the meaning of the word no. Doesn't listen to his patients. Also the office is very disorganized. If you make an appointment online they cancel because he's not in that day. If he's not going to be in why do you show open appointments?	0
Best personal physician I have had in a long time.	2
I really enjoy my appointments with Dr. Beddis, He is the Best, so personable and on point. Kudo's  Doc!	2
Best doctor hands down. He doesn’t rush you out of your appointment, and actually cares. Seeing him is not like going to other doctors, he makes the environment a very comfortable place and how most doctors office visits should be. He will go beyond and over and listen to his patients and give the best possible help and knowledgeable advice. 	2
My family has been going to Dr. Beddis for the last 8 years. Originally we picked the practice because it was close and offered evenings and some Saturday appointments.  He has watched my children grow up and is the only doctor my youngest child has ever had. He is very caring. He explains everything in regular words for myself and the kids to understand. He's a Great doctor! The office is clean and organized. His assistant Erica also goes over and beyond to make sure the kids feel comfortable. 	2
Dr. Beddis was well organized, patient centered, and explained medical issues in a very patient friendly way.  He took time to connect with me on a personal level and he didn't rush me through the appointment. 	2
Dr. Beddis is helpful and capable. I have never felt rushed when I've had an appointment with him. 	2
Excellent doctor! Easy to talk to. Always straight and to the point! 	2
Dr. Beddis listens well. He is knowledgeable and amiable.	2
Good prep on follow up appointments. He offers a full health care advice beyond traditional medicines. 	2
Dr. Beddis is a great doctor. I would not trade the man for another doctor at all. 	2
I was in the office 4/30/18 with wrist pain and while I was leaving I felt lightheaded and nauseous. Dr Beddis advised me to sit down and he would get me some water. He came back with a pretzel(that he took the salt off of) lol and a cup of water. He stayed in the room and chatted with me until I felt better. I appreciate the time Dr. Beddis spent speaking with me and ensuring I felt better when he had other patients. 	2
"Dr. Beddis, is patient and interested in hearing about his patient's concerns in addition to the reason for the visit.  He gives helpful hints to encourage exercise and intake of healthy foods. He has a flexible schedule and availability to meet with his patients.  I appreciate his medical advice.
I recently recommended Dr. Beddis to a colleague."	2
Dr. Beddis is very thorough and caring.  Ready to disucss your concerns and work with you.	2
I would recommend Dr Beddis to anyone.  He is very helpful and works with the patient. 	2
Dr. Beddis is thorough, courteous, insightful and non-judgmental. At my annual physical, he was careful to review my previous visits and history, and to follow-up on previous complaints. He consulted a checklist of items requiring examination or consultation to insure that nothing was overlooked. I am significantly overweight, but he has never expressed disgust or treated me as though I must be lazy and/or stupid. He pushes me toward better health without judgment and applauds my slow success.	2
Dr. Beddis is very friendly and personable.  There is never a sense of rushing, and has always been willing to take the time to listen to what I've had to say, and make sure he addresses my thoughts and concerns to my satisfaction.  I have been a patient for about 1 year, and I'm very happy I made the decision to see Dr. Beddis as my primary care provider.	2
Dr. Beddis is a knowledgeable, caring, and patient doctor. He fully explains everything so that you have a clear understanding of your situations. And carefully listens to you to resolve all matters of a medical nature. Highly recommended.	2
Dr. Beddis is the most professional, kind, understanding, attentive, doctor I have ever met and dealt with.  The entire office staff is friendly and they make you feel like family. I would recommend this wonderful office to all my friends. Dr. Beddis is knowledgeable and treats you with respect and is considerate to ones feeling and condition.        	2
I had an excellent visit with Dr. Beddis. He and the staff made me feel very comfortable. They were prompt and professional. Dr. Beddis was very well informed of recent guidelines for various conditions and we had a thorough conversation about each of them all while maintaining a warm bedside manner. 	2
Great person to talk to. I felt very comfortable talking about issues and concerns!	2
He is very kind and patient. He has been the best family doctor I’ve seen. I have no plans to go to anyone else. 	2
Dr. Beddis listens! He doesn't assume and prescribe as some doctors do. He has a conversation with me before giving me his recommendation. He is also forward thinking-he looks ahead and helps me to plan and set goals for my overall health. I appreciate that about him!	2
He's nice and he is friendly, but he is not the most helpful Doc I have had. He's also really hard to get an appointment with.	0
She’s hands down the best doctor out there. She’s serious about her work and her patients health and progress. She goes the extra mile to make sure you recover from any ailment you may be experiencing. I have already recommended her to all of my friends and family. She helped me get past one of the scariest times of my adult life. I don’t know where I’d be without her! 	2
She is arrogant and condescending. She will only treat you if you agree to monthly visits.  That wasn’t specified up front.  I think it’s absurd to have that kind of prerequisite.  She feels you need to trust her since she’s a doctor.  She said “you have insurance, what’s the problem” & was argumentative.  I believe in a doctor/patient partnership.  If anyone I’ve just met is telling me to trust them, it is not a good sign. Trust is earned, not given blindly. She listened to my heart, took my BP, & scanned blood work (which I supplied) & a list of my medications.  She wanted to stop 1 medication, replace another with a new medication, & add an additional new medication. I’m managing 3 conditions & taking 4 medications.  It’s difficult to introduce something new. Something beneficial for 1 condition exacerbates another.  She didn’t bother to check to insure there wouldn’t be a problem between her recommendations and my current medication. I would never recommend her.  	0
I would never recommend Dr. Roya Jarafi-Hassad. The office is incredibly disorganized. My privacy is not valued. My records were never reviewed. I was incorrectly billed and incorrectly diagnosed more times than I care to count. I would skip this place even if my life depended on it.	0

This was the best team of medical staff I have been around in a long time.Beautiful clean office and  I would love to have them around if I ever get sick again. Dr Hassad was so  busy but still took the time to make me feel like I was the only patient there. The medical assistant (  Lida ) that took my initial information and medical history  was terrific, she too made me feel like I was the first patient of the day. I loved visiting and if I need their service again I know I will be welcomed.” 	2

true Healer , very thorough and experienced general doctor and antiaging specialoist 	2
Disorganized, rude, nasty front desk.  They don't know if they are coming or going.  This doctor has no respect for her patients.  Avoid. 	0
she is highly experienced , write to the point and efficient , with excellent bedside manner and beautiful smile , her staff are super kind and organized as well 	2
Let me start by saying that I never write reviews. My experience with Dr. Hassad ,however, compelled me to leave one. This was the worst experience I've ever had with a doctor. She is completely unprofessional, demeaning, and rude. Aside from that her practice should be investigated. She wanted to perform tests that had nothing to do with my condition. I also found questionable claims on my insurance. I'm afraid this doctor is taking advantage of her patients.	0
This doctor is dangerous. She does not care about her patients or their health. Performs unnecessary tests so she can bill your insurance company. Charges you out of pocket for vitamin shots and other tests performed in her office. Never addressed my serious medical needs. I hope this review will save others from the disservice this woman is giving to people. Just do your research. Google her and do not be fooled by positive reviews. They are written by her staff I’m sure. 	0
awesome doctor with great team!!!	2
Dr Roya exercises poor bedside manner, rude demeanor, and made me immediately uncomfortable upon my first visit at her office on Park Ave.  I feel bad for her much more professional nurses and secretary.  Not only did I have a series of unnecessary tests for THREE hours but I witnessed her yelling at other patients during that time because they didn't understand what she was saying with her thick accent!  I've NEVER in my 16 yrs. of living in Manhattan experienced such unprofessional treatment!	0
Lovely doctor! 	2
excellent doctor, beautiful office, very helpful staff,! I have been searching for many years looking for a very thorough and highly skilled doctor and finally I found Dr roya Hassad !	2
amazing doctor and staff !!	2
Very rude and unprofessional doctor and nurses, really bad experience. Don't go there, trust me. She only cares your money and even didn't what she was doing.	0

Most caring doctor in the world.  knowledgeable, dedicated, thorough, great hands, all the doctors he works with are excellent and love him!  TY DOC!	2
Dr. George happens to have the best bed side manners I have ever seen. He is so kind and caring about each and everyone of his patients.  There are also other doctors there working with him that are also very kind and I have also seen all of them. I always feel I am getting the best care possible and a follow-up to see how I am doing. You will never be let down if you pick this doctor plus there’s a medical Spa which Dr George and his wife Nicole do fabulous treatments there.  You really need to look into this Spa. 	2
He is the kindest, most caring doctor. The best bedside manner. I got pink eye over the weekend and he took my call and saved the day. He did not wait till Monday and it was almost gone by Monday. He is the best!	2
Dr. George is the best doctor in NYC. His professionalism is crowned by a divine humanity rooted in the love for others and for his wonderful family. His tireless passion to see his patients blossom, his multifaceted talent with which he juggles effortlessly, as a true master of medicine & love, make him unparalleled. Tens of patients are waiting to be consulted by Dr. George & when they leave they wear the broadest smile because have met a true doctor and being made in the face and love of God.	2
Dr. George is always available, will personally respond to calls/answer questions.  You never feel unsupported and alone, which is becoming a rarity in this day and age.	2
I was referred to Dr. Liakeas back in 2012 and can I say he is a truly a breath of fresh air and very informative.  You never feel as if you are being rushed through your visit and you feel that he is giving you a genuine response when speaking to him.  If he is not available to see you (intern or other doctor may see you) for your appointment he will come in at the end of your visit and follow-up with you to make sure all of your questions have been answered.  	2
He's a fantastic Doctor. 	2
The best! Everybody in here. Quick, efficient and nice.	2
Dr. Cohen is very lovely and I was also ecstatic that I didn't have to wait in the waiting room or the exam room AT ALL.	2
Dr. Cohen is smart, attentive and lovely to talk to.     He was completely on top of all my medical issues during my annual exam even though he hadn’t seen me for a year.   He answered all of my questions.     I highly recommend him.	2
Dr. Cohen is great, but unfortunately his office is on the pediatric floor.  As an older man, I felt very uncomfortable.  Waiting and examining rooms are for children, not adults. 	0
He is a great doctor and seems to care, takes his time and is super professional!	2
Dr Cohen was very calm and patient. He took his time with us. He calmed my daughter down.  I would recommend him to anyone.	2
Wonderful personality, very sharp and intuitive. Highly recommend.	2
On-time, professional, attentive	2
Professional, digital, easy, good staff, blood drawn on site...really great!	2
Will recommend Dr. Cohen to everyone I know. That's how good he is.	2
Great doctor with great manners. Very knowledgeable	2
Listens to concerns, companionate, takes the time and doesn’t rush the conversation, thorough, patient, understanding.	1
"Dr Cohen was friendly, confident in his work and made me feel 100% taken care of and comfortable.
As as side note, his staff was equally as engaging and knowledgeable about their job, extremely welcoming and kind. 
I also love the Dr Suess paper that covers the bench you lay on, as well as the general office vibe."	2
I had my first annual physical exam with Dr. Cohen recently and he's terrific. It's not easy for doctors to connect with their patients in the short appointment time allotted to them, but he conveyed both his expertise and interest in my well-being during my visit. I am so happy he's my PCP!	2
Excellent in all facets,very supporting and knowledgeable	2
Dr. Cohen is very thorough and has an excellent bedside manner.  As the son and brother to Nurse Practitioners, I've had a lot of interaction with medical personnel.  I would recommend Dr. Cohen to anyone.	2
Listens well and shares medical information. Caring and smart.	2
"Excellent. Thorough exam and treatment plan. 
He is always available and knows how to treat me. "	2
"He was friendly professional and put me at ease immediately 
He asked great questions and made good suggestions- great bedside manner!"	2
Excellent	2
"Routine, regular check-up
Could not have been more friendly or efficient"	2
Dr Cohen was very friendly and professional. He really cares about his patients. He speak Spanish fluently and I recommend him 100%.	2
Highly likely 	2
Great!!	2
He’s a wonderful caring patient doctor with excellent bed side manors who I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. 	2
Best Doctor I have ever had.	2
Very friendly and very trustworthy. Always a smile on his face, so easy to communicate with him. So far I am very happy with Dr. Cohen. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to friends and family at anytime. 	2
As always excellent quality time with Dr Cohen speaking in understandable terms regarding my health.  I feel fortunate to have Dr Cohen as my primary physician 	2
Very friendly and efficient visit. Dr. Cohen is professional and remembers patients so it's a great overall experience. Medical advice is appropriate and trustworthy.	2
Dr. Cohen is a very kind and patient doctor who is especially good at calming fears. You feel like everything will be OK when you leave his office.	2
"You couldn't ask more from Dr. Cohen.
He's a little intense (appropriately), but he's also friendly.  
He's essentially what I want to see in a physician."	2
Dr. Cohen is easy to talk to, knowledgeable, smart and kind. I rarely have to wait more than five minutes, my last visit they called my name exactly on time. The staff is very helpful and friendly, and the waiting area is nicely designed and clean! They even have great magazines. On my visit a few days ago, Dr. Cohen answered all my questions and responded to my email questions as well. Amazing.	2
Very nice doctor, open to listening to you, and very through. 	2
Exceptional service and professionalism!	2
I enrolled Dr. Cohen as my primary care physician and found him to be professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.	2
Dr Cohen and his staff scheduled me for a visit promptly. He is knowledgeable and friendly and has a strong network of physicians at his disposal should you need additional care. 	2
I am a patient of dr Cohen. He Iknows his patients and provides practical suggestions for dealing with health related issues.	1
He’s good if you need a flu shot or a strep test.  Otherwise, he is incurious and a bit condescending.  If you are in good health and want someone to prescribe an occasional antibiotic, he’s your guy.  If you want someone with an intellect to act as the “quarterback” to coordinate and make referrals to specialists when your health heads south, which is how good internists add value, don’t waste your breath: Find a competent internist somewhere else.	0
No wait. Excellent diagnosis and next steps 	2
The best Doctor i ever had in this Country. He was always worried about my health. It helped me to stabilize my depression and the best thing is that he has a giant heart. thanks Dr Cohen. I miss you a lot, nothing is the same after you left Open door Medical Center ??	2
Dr. Cohen is warm, gentle and personable...what I value most in a Family Physician. Without that there can be no healing, I believe. 	2
Friendly doctor! Highly recommend.	2
I liked Dr.Asaf Cohen and I think that he's a great doctor and I'll continuing seeing him as my doctor	2
Always feel like I’m in the best of hands. 	2
I already have! 	1
Dr. Cohen takes the time to get to know his patients and will not rush you through an appointment. He is also pleasant and friendly and takes your concerns seriously. 	2
Dr. Cohen takes the time to listen.   He makes you feel like he cares about you as a person. 	2
Dr Cohen is excellent, professional, warm, knowledgeable and caring. A wonderful doctor for my teenager and whole family! Thank you! 	2
Nice and Knowledgable.	2
Looking for a good doctor? Look no further.	2
I became a patient of Doctor Cohen’s after my previous PCP accepted a position outside of New York. The transformation was very smooth. Dr. Cohen is very easy to talk to (even about rather sensitive sexual health issues). He’s thorough in his examination, listens well, explains clearly, and makes a patient feel comfortable/at ease. That’s actually true of the support staff as well. The receptionists are very welcoming. The nurses are equally personable. I never have to wait. It’s well managed.	2
I use him for annual check-ups. He seems thorough and is easy to talk with.  The office is pretty average in terms of wait times, mixing up paperwork, etc.  They have good days and not so good ones.	2
"Great provider, cares about his patients!
Recommend him to everyone that asks for a pcp to follow up with and maintain their health"	2
I didn't have a family physician and needed clearance for surgery.  It was a great experience and will definitely use him as my doctor from now on.	2
No other word to describe Dr Kapadia then excellent. She save my life. her knowledge if unbelievable. I cant thank her enough for she did for me.	2
I've been going to Dr. Kapadia for about 2 years now, followed her from her last practice. Not only has every visit been a pleasant time but I've learned something new each visit. She is very thorough when checking you, also very knowledgeable making it easy to understand what is going on. You can feel she genuinely cares about her patients, and truly wants to help them out. Her staff has always been nothing but kind and helpful! I would recommend Dr. Kapadia 1000 times!	2
Compassionate, patient, knowledgeable. Followed her from her last practice and would do it again. Never makes you feel rushed and truly cares about her patients. Office staff  is great too! Highly recommended. 	2
"Dr. Ruby Kapadia is, by far, the most attentive and considerate doctor I've had the pleasure of seeing. Gone are the days of wringing my hands over a doctor's visit and thinking ""Will they listen to me? Will they take me seriously? Is the medication they prescribe me going to have scary side-effects?"" Dr. Kapadia's character is indicated by her in-depth questions, warm bedside manner, and expanse of information she shares with you before making any diagnosis or medicine prescription (which is primarily a holistic approach). Aside from comfortable visits, Dr. Kapadia always does her best to figure out a treatment program based on your financial situation, and you will in no way feel like you're getting lower quality care just because you're pressed for finances. I've been going to this doctor for about a year and recommend her to anyone who asks. "	2
Office is clean, staff friendly and helpful and dr is thoughtful, intelligent and thorough.	2
Dr. Kapadia is the best doctor I have ever been too. She is extremely thorough and takes her time discussing any issues you may be having. I have never had a doctor spend so much time getting to know me on a personal level! She truly cares about you as a patient, and I would highly reccomend her to anyone. The staff is wonderful as well! 	2
Dr. Kapadia knows how to listen and show compassion for people. She is an excellent doctor, I would recommend her to all my friends and family 	2
Staff is respectful and courteous.  Exam rooms are very modern.  We follow her from her last practice --worth the 28 minute commute.  I had stopped seeing a doc for a long time and gained much weight, felt sick.  But now thanks to Doc, I feel much better and regularly take care of my health.  Just go see her once and you will know what a great doctor is.  Best kept secret in New Jersey.  She is terrific. 	2
By far the most intelligent and compassionate doctor I have ever had. Brilliant at diagnosis and treatment. 	2
Dr. Kapadia is very knowledgable and thorough, with a very personal bedside manner. I highly recommend her!	2
I enjoy seeing him. I actually like going to the doctor. My boyfriend referred me. Dr.Tipu is meticulous, compassionate, friendly, respectful, dedicated and patient. He should be the Recipient of The Physician of A Lifetime Award.	2
Takes long time. Appointments mean nothing, otherwise pretty good services.  They should be more professional with appointments	0
Dr Tipu was the most pleasant, professional, humble and respectful doctor I’ve seen in a very long time. He was very attentive and through throughout my entire visit. So happy I found a PCP that I can say I’ll keep for life. 	2
Best Doctor to go to.  So caring and nice.  The staff too are so polite and caring.	2
Very caring and knowledgeable doctor. Never rushes you through a session. Excellent bedside manner. Always answer questions and explain medical conditions and makes recommendations if necessary. Takes walk-in which is very helpful.	2
"This is a walk in clinic not a private practice.  It is first come first served.  Appointments mean nothing.

Total time in office is about 3 hours.  Its a shame because I like Dr. Tipu but no doctor's visit should take 3 hours.  Its unacceptable and absurd."	0
He is a great doctor, and his whole staff is amazing	2
Dr. Tipu is one of the most caring person for over 5 years, knowing him. he explain in details all test taken and takes the time to go over the results with me been diabetic, he is very smart and take care of me. We need more doctors like him, Thanks for taken care of me. I will recommend this doctor to anyone he is the best. No complaint.	2
I went to see him while visiting my daughter who is a regular patient of his. I was unwell and my daughter notified MD Tipu who suggested I come in despite not having a standing appointment. I'm a diabetic who's sugar was not well controlled. My previous doctor would not listen to my request to change my medicines but Dr. Tipu listened and made changes. Ever since seeing Dr. Tipu my sugars are much better now. I've decided to change over to Dr.Tipu. He is caring, listens, and excellent overall.	2
Dr. Tipu takes you through the logical reasoning leading to his decisions and judgments. He has sound justification for treatments and knows when not to treat. I have been treated many physicians or various  degrees of competence. Dr. Tipu is outstanding. 	2
He is a great doctor, and his whole staff is amazing 	2
Best doctor in the history of time.  I'm so proud of your accomplishments.  We met as children but you have supported me through the horrors of being chewed up and spat out by the NHS Mental Health Services four times.  I was always a nervous girl.  You know that.  You never questioned my truth.  Thanks for being almost like a father figure to me.  I know that sounds confused but I suppose what I mean is that you have always listened to me with a compassionate air and accepted that was bright!	2
Dr tipu has been my primary care doctor for over 4 years best doctor in Brooklyn hands down. From the common cold to a major surgery he has been there as a doctor and a friend.	1
"I became his patient during his residency.I have followed him and now I consider him as a friend. He is the doctor to my wife , my one daughter and two sons.
Good man with a good heart.He treated my family members from Jamaica whenever they come to Usa and he has never charged a penny.I have a lot of respect for him. God bless him and his family . "	2
Pleasant experience seeing him for the first time. 	2
Excellent experience! Awesome Doctor he spent fair bit of time in explaining my medication situation. Highly recommended. 	2
"Dr. Tipu is a good doctor, HOWEVER, the way he runs his practice like a walk in clinic is an abomination. Prepare to spend 3 hrs.   God forbid you need to get a prescription filled by phone.  I spoke to dr. Tipu on phone who was to send in a prescription but he filled wrong dosage.  I called his office 10 times to correct prescription and was yessed to death only to be ignored.  I gave up.  Completely unprofessional.

"I should have also mentioned in my previous reviews. I am a nurse :) 

And I throughly trust my doctor, Dr. Tipu. "	2
I have seen many doctors never had a pcp till Dr. TIPU. I love that he takes him time n explain everything to u. He never rushes u out or make u feel like u asking a stupid question.Love Love Love Dr.TIPU	2
Horrible dr more worried about giving controlled substance then actually doing his job went to see him and got no help left me to suffer hope he gets what he deserves 1 day	0
Excelte doctor	2
Recently, I gave birth to a baby boy at HUMC.  Although my son was healthy, I, on the other hand, had complications so I had to stay at the hospital for a total of six days.  Dr. Dominguez truly was the only doctor I was excited to see because he was very compassionate and really listened to me, whereas, the other doctors were a little more robotic and hasty in their ways.  I'm very thankful for him and hopefully I'll be able to make an appt. to see him soon!	2
Dr. Vaynkof took a lot of time to both listen to my concerns and to explain things to me.	1
Dr. Vaynkof took a lot of time to both listen to my concerns and to explain things to me.	1
Dr. Vaynkof took a lot of time to both listen to my concerns and to explain things to me.	1
very positive... great team!	2
Yevgeniy listened to everything I had to say and asked very pertinent questions. He ordered tests that helped me explain my symptoms, and gave me peace of mind.	2
Dr. Vaynkof and his staff were great, the entire process, from check in to check out was very easy; they were very efficient. Dr. Vaynkof is very knowledgeable, and thorough.	2
"The front staff is not too helpful. You have to call several times to get a document and they still do not mail it. I think they need training.
the medical assistant who took care of me was very welcoming and professional. Dr Vaynkof has excellent bedside manners."	1
Doctor Vaynkof was great! Took his time and did not make me feel rushed for asking questions. Very professional	2
Dr. Vaynkof was very thorough in his examination and made sure that I had everything I was looking for.	2
Staff was great, doctor was awesome	2
A very good experience. I felt listened to. I informed Dr. Vaynkof that I may be allergic to dog dander and pollen and was very eager to schedule proper testing to see if I was. Overall,  attention to detail, 5 stars.	2
"Great to have a doctor that will listin and review all my issues.
Than gives a clear outline what I need to do moving forward."	2
I always appreciate that Dr. Vaynkof expresses genuine concern and care during our checkups.	2
I am very pleased with Dr. Burshteyn. He seems knowledgeable, he's willing to take his time with his patients and listen. He has a good sense of humor making it even easier to open up to him. He has a nice staff too. I will be returning for another visit the next time I'm in medical need. 	2
To echo the other 5-star reviews, Dr. Mansour is all I could have hoped for in a medical practitioner. He always provides the absolute best care, and I believe, best advice and treatment during every visit and for every issue. He cares about his patients’ well-being, and takes the time to explain his thinking. I’ve consulted many doctors in my life, and it is rare to find someone as knowledgable and accommodating as Dr. Mansour. 	2
Dr. Gaysynsky Is easy to speak to and takes the time needed for each visit. The office staff is polite and accommodating. I recommend him to family and friends needing a great doctor.	2
I had reason to come here for a check up and prescription refills. Dr Gaysynsky and the staff were very warm and friendly. The doctor was very helpful and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend him. Thank you Doc!	2
Dr. Gaysynsky is a wonderful doctor. He is very patient and thorough. I always recommend him. His staff is always very nice and helpful. They answer questions and make sure that my requests are fulfilled quickly. I am always very happy coming here. Regular checkups to concerns are always well taken care of. I feel very confident in Dr. Gaysynsky's care. Patient flow is good, so there is little to no wait time. 	2
Been going to Dr gaysynsky for 3 years now. Always a great experience.	2
Pleasant and knowledgeable staff. Good and QUALITY care	2
 Dr Gaysynsky is one of the best doctors I've ever met. He is patient and kind and very thorough. He is 5+ stars	2
Very caring doctor. Listens to patients concerns and provides treatment of quality. 	2
Dr G is a great doctor who really cares about you. He is thorough and takes his time. Office is super clean and his staff is definitely friendly.	2
I've only been there once. I did schedule another visit that means so far so good. I will post more reviews after I get more comfortable with this doctor. Office is super clean and staff seems friendly.	2
Great dentist with an excellent team !!!	2
Always a positive experience. On-time, friendly staff, and makes all procedures stress-free.	2
Dr Shek is the best!! I will never go anywhere else but him!	2
Dr. Sheklian and his staff are very professional and knowledgeable. 	2
Dr. Sheklian is an outstanding dentist. Highly skilled and very thoughtful about what work, if any, is required for the patient. Dr. Sheklian is very approachable, friendly, and never without a smile. His staff of dental professionals are similarly excellent. The administrative staff are nothing short of extraordinary. They will diligently work on the patient's behalf to ensure that insurance covers the maximum amount possible. If they have to spend extra time to save you as little as $15, they actually will do that. This tenacious level of advocacy for patients is both rare and remarkable in the contemporary medical system but is par for the course with this practice. Need to reschedule? Not a problem. The staff will find you a new spot and, should a more convenient spot open up, they'll reach out and let you know right away. I'd have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Dr. Sheklian and his staff and indeed have done so on multiple occasions.	2
AVOID THIS DENTIST!   I trusted this dentist & was a patient from 2015-2019 & went 4x a year for cleanings & evaluation.  Dr. Sheklian continually told me year after year that everything was fine & that I had no cavities.  I left his practice on 10 Apr 2019 and to date have had to have 3 teeth removed due to infection and decay that Dr. Sheklian told me were fine.  In Feb 2019 I had a root canal done by Dr. Sheklian which took him over 8 weeks to complete.  Dr. Sheklian broke my tooth when he forcefully placed the crown on nearly breaking my jaw along with it all while yelling at me to hold still.  Because he broke my tooth, it became infected, extremely painful & had to be removed.  If you value your health & teeth, don't go to this dentist. 	0
This is a best-in-class practice! Dr Sheklian is a true professional and the staff is exceptional.	2
The staff is always pleasant. Service with a great smile!	2
Dr SHEKLIAN and his staff are very professional and thorough. Every visit is a painless one. No visit has ever been a rushed visit. Everything is explained along the way. He even goes above and beyond to work with insurance companies so that your visits are worry free!!  I highly recommend this practice. 	2
Dr. Sheklian office is the best. Friendly, very accommodating and they make the insurance nightmare easier. His entire staff goes over and above above the normal call of duty. If you are looking ?? for the best dentist on the southern Monmouth county are look no further. Call his office now and you will see what I am talking about.  	2
Highly knowledgeable, professional and personable. He discovered and has successfully treated a gum condition that my prior dentist had missed. I can't say enough good things about him and his team 	2
After going to other dentists since moving here 3 years ago, I finally found Dr. Sheklian...  he is professional and thorough... and his staff is just as professional...  I highly recommend Dr. Sheklian... 	2
"The best!!!!
Every person employed there is happy and that says a lot. I wouldn’t go anywhere else. "	2
You can't find a more caring dentist!	2
Have been a long time patient of Dr. Sheklian. He and staff are nothing short of the utmost in professional and quality. The atmosphere and care are first the best I had in my lifetime of dental care	2
Dr. Sheklian and his staff are truly wonderful!  They ensure that your experience, from general exams and cleanings to more involved and complicated procedures are done in a professional manner that instills confidence, and in a caring and friendly manner that creates a calm, comfortable environment.  Dr. Sheklian and staff are very considerate of, and responsive to, individual needs.  They successfully strive to make your visits with them a pleasant experience.	2
I have been going to Dr. Sheklian for years and always have a wonderful experience. Dr. Sheklian is extraordinary and knowledgeable. He takes his time to explain everything in a very detailed manner. Everyone in the office treats you with the care and consideration that they would their own family. I highly recommend Dr. Sheklian. He and his staff make going to the dentist a pleasure!!	2
"Experiences: 1)My daughter got two days after treatment for small cavity strong pain and he refused to take her back. Told me to give her Tylenol! I asked him to redo filling, what he did and he apologized that he thought the cavity was very small so he didn't give her some layer. 2)We used his service for other 2 years until the office didn't give me appointment for emergency tooth pain - I had to find and go next day to other dentist.
3)He did bad crown to my husband- had to be replaced later."	0
"Wonderful Dr,staff also great,professional, immaculate treatment rooms .
Highly recommend!!!!"	2
Not only is Dr. Sheklian an incredible dentist, he is an artist who is extremely caring. 	2
For 20 plus years, Mark and his team have provided me and my family of 5 outstanding dental care in the most professional and courteous manner. Mark’s easygoing style perfectly complements his extensive knowledge. We resoundingly endorse Dr Sheklian and his team of professionals and administrators. 	2
"Great staff, they are very  friendly. Dr Sheklian is  the best. 

Christian "	2
Dr. Sheklian is professional, reassuring, and personable. He explains everything, and doesn’t over treat. His staff, especially the hygienists Liz and Patty, are wonderful. Dr. Sheklian took over a practice from my long time dentist, Dr. Wood, and I like Dr. Sheklian as much as my former dentist. That’s saying a lot!  	2
Dr. Sheklian is my hero. He was so incredibly kind to my 89 year old mother that I would have to pinch myself so I wouldn't well up with tears. Dr.Sheklian treated my mother as if she were his own mother....with dignity, kindness and patience. My mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease and had no short term memory. All of her teeth started breaking off at the root and I was so afraid she was in pain but wasnt letting me know..Dr.Sheklian took amazing care of her! Highly skilled & kind hearted!	2
I am thrilled with my first visit to Dr. Sheklian.  The staff was awesome.  The office was very clean and beautiful.  I got my first appointment within a week of calling for a consultation and loose crown.  Dr. Sheklian was very attentive to my level of comfort during the exam.  He fully explained everything in terms I understood and spent a lot of time going over everything with me.  I feel he treated me like a good friend or member of his own family in the plan for treatment and referral!!!	2
I have been a patient of his practice for 10 plus years. He is an EXCELLENT dentist who is caring and professional .  His staff are friendly and professional. 	2
I could go on and on about this man and his staff, but I'm just going to say this:  If you are afraid of the dentist, or you have not gone in a long time and you are ashamed or embarrassed-make an appointment to see Dr. Sheklian and his staff. You won't regret it. 	1
Over the years, Dr. Sheklian and his team have provided me not only with unparalleled dental and orthodontic work, but they have done so in a consistent, friendly and professional manner. 	2
She and her entire team are wonderful. I hadn’t been to the dentist in several years and they made me feel at ease and answered all of my questions. Thank you!	2
Dr. Quartey and staff were very friendly and attentive to my needs.	2
just started  to go too driving Meyer's after going to my previous  dentist who retired that be said i,m very pleased with Dr Meyer's  and his staff hoping to be going for a while	2
Dr. Callas is a fabulous doctor and I can honestly say I do not mind going to the dentist! She puts your mind at ease and puts great care into what she does.	2
Dr Arida is a outstanding dentist and a truly wonderful person. Although we relocated from Westfield 10 years ago when we retired, we still make the 50 mile trip back to Westfield to see him for all our dental and implant needs. He and his staff are the quintessential professionals that come along rarely in a lifetime. We have absolute trust and confidence in him and have been well cared for for many, many years. Outstanding indeed...Steve & Leslie Kozik, Lambertville NJ	2
Dr. A should stand for Dr. Amazing. I have an extreme fear of the dentist and for the first time in my life, I felt at peace in a dental chair. He has the softest touch and the best staff. After moving to New York, I was nervous about finding a new dentist since I've been having so many issues with my teeth, but Dr. A solved all my problems and I can finally eat my favorite foods again. I strongly recommend him for all your dental needs. 	2

For my whole life (I'm 58) dentist kept telling me I would have to remove teeth to get my front top and bottom straightened out until I met Dr. Milman.

"what an experience - all my years of going to the dentist my first visit to family dental care was excellent. Issue that i had (cosmetically) was addressed and i was given a solution.
Never had i have a lead vest to protect my thyroid.
the staff was very warm and friendly.
I will be back with my three girls!"	2
My experience was refreshing.  I was recommended by a trusted person and they had nothing but good things to say about this provider.  I agree 100%.  My initial experience was one of caring, skillful and knowledgeable professionals with this provider and it has continues.  I recommend this provider to anyone and everyone that mentions a need for a dentist.	2
Dr. Beague and his staff are extraordinary. The service is professionally administered. The staff is courteous and the work done is efficient. I highly recommend this office.	2
Excellent service and professionalism. I have been a client of Dr. Beague for over 20 years. The service has always been above average, consistent high quality, and professional.

I am deathly afraid of the dentist and literally shake thinking about just making an appointment.  France  and Dr. Beague literally made me feel so comfortable and at home.  We literally laughed so much before I had my wisdom tooth pulled.  He was amazing and I adore France. They explained everything they were doing to me and made me so relieved.  I highly recommend them.	2
Nicest dentist's office I have ever been to, extremely friendly staff and doctor. Explained everything to me very clearly, and, amazingly, an almost completely pain-free root canal.	2
I was recommended to Family Dental Care of Elmont by a coworker and I'm glad I followed her recommendation. Dr. Beague is very knowledgeable and made me feel at ease while being treated.	2
I am very pleased with my experience at Family Dental Care of Elmont. Dr. Thomas was very detailed with his explanations, and was very willing to listen to my questions and concerns.	2

He is really good at listening to your needs; compassionate and caring. Have great bed/chair side manners. I have been going to him for years and will never go elsewhere!	2
Would definitely recommend.. Trustworthy.	2
"It's all in the headline. Honestly now that I think about it, a great personality is invaluable when it comes to dentistry, and Thomas is gushing with it, assuaging all possible fears. The man knows what he's doing and I always see a smile on his face. I really don't know how he does it. He is SO accommodating. His assistant was also really helpful in giving me advice on how to floss. (Biggest takeaway: DON'T BE STINGY!) 
Love this man ."	2
the cleanliness of the place is a+. the staff  very pleasant and patient	2
"I Absolutely love coming to Family Dental Care in Elmont NY.

His staff is the same they are professional and courteous.  I never have a problem getting a reasonable appointment and I have never ever waited more than 5 minutes to be seen.  I have recommended many people to him because I truly believe in his care, treatment plans and concern.

I have been going to Dr. Beague from about 1998 and will not go anywhere else. He is the best!	2
I enjoyed every moment of my visit.	2

"My Dentist, Dr. Wolf, retired after 40 years of practice, and recommended me to Dr. Beague.  My visit was extraordinary.  The moment I entered the office , I felt as if I was a patient for a long time because of the greetings I received.  The staff is warm, treated me as if they knew me before.  Dr. Beague is professional, knowledgeable, and I am going to recommend everyone I know to him.

The entire staff of University Dental is absolutely amazing. I recommend family and friends to this practice all the time! I found them on a whim on 1800 Dentists. I was interested in braces. It's been 2 years of services since my consultation and I've never had a complaint. Dr. Silverman and staff love their job and it shows!	2
"They don't care very much for the patients.  I went in and they told me I needed a root canal... it would run me around two thousand dollars without insurance.  
Firstly I declined service and called other dentists in the area and got quotes for exactly the same 3 procedures and got lower costs by over 500 from all other dentists. 
Secondly I ended up going to a dentist and immediately said I didn't need a route canal.  I ended up getting a cleaning and a filling and saved my tooth and my wallet"	0
I have been using Dr. Silverman for four years and have found him to be professional, knowledgeable, and amiable.  His office in Bellmore, NY is equipped with the latest technology and is staffed by friendly and professional people. He also has several specialists working with him so that a patient need not travel to other locales for specialized treatment.   I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Silverman.	2
I've been a patient of University Dental for over 15 years.  During that time I've had extensive implant work.  The practice is distinguished by, among other things, both painlessness and thoroughness.  Both the practitioners and the hygienists go to great lengths to make the treatments as comfortable as possible.  Every visit, including simple teeth cleaning, is accompanied by a careful dental health checkup.  During one of these Dr. Silverman detected what proved to be a parotid gland (spit gl	2
Dr Urbankova shows an exceptional level of commitment toward dentristry and her patients. She has a sense of zeal about preventive care and helping to ensure that her patients are educated about their tooth conditions. She is very gentle and explains the process of her work during the visit. She has great technical skills and you feel her sense of joy of her profession andthe care she offers her patients. Also the office staff are very caring and their office is very aesthetically comforting to be in during your visit.	2
I would like to share my experience at the Dr. Urbankova dental office. This dentist is probably the best you would encounter in NYC. Excellent dental services, outstanding patients' treatment and all in all atmosphere. Highly recommended	2
I've been coming to see Dr. Urbankova for over a year and I am very satisfied with her care. She has helped me so much to help keep all of my teeth. I have had a lot of issues in the past but now im starting to feel a lot better with less sensitivity and less pain.	2
When I came to Dr. Urbankova office for the first time, it was just lucky chance. From now on it is my dentist every time when I need to visit an office. Highly recommended!	2
She is the best dentist I've had.  The only one who is doing everything to save my teeth and giving me a lot of hope and encouragement.  Thank you!	2

a kind gentle professional.truly the best dental experience of my life	2
just love it	2
My husband and i had various issues with our teeth. We were on     the verge of many root canals and possibly removals. But Dr. Urbankova through her many efforts were able to save the teeth from having root canal and thus preserving our teeth. I am so glad we have met her. Even when we are in Florida for the winter, my husband and I will not go to any dentist down there. we will wait till we are home in New York. Her dedication to preserving teeth is highly appreciated.	2
I receive clear and detailed explanations of procedures. I receive patient and accurate care. I trust that the best decisions are suggested for my dental care and that we are looking at the best possible outcomes. I value a lot that my teeth are preserved. I also learn a lot about how to take care of my teeth so that less and less intervention will be needed. I also appreciate that Dr. Urbankova spends all the necessary time to achieve the best results.	2
Dr. Engebretson explained to me all  different implants and pros and con of the use of any type. We discuss every step of the treatment. Now I feel like a part of the process not only as a patient, but as a member of the staff. He is so experience and knowledgeable, it is amazing experience for me.	2
The doctors took the best care of me from beginning to end. The implant procedure was painless and I was able to return to work the same day. I knew I was in the best hands and they proved once again that they are far superior to other dentists I've seen in the past.	2
Dr. Urbankova is and her staff are exceptional at what they do. From the minute you walk in you're treated with excellent care. The whole staff is very knowledgeable and caring. I wouldn't recommend anyone else!! Thank you for all your care!	2
Dr. Urbankova is the best! She does a great job of thoroughly explaining everything that is going on so that I feel we have a shared plan on preserving my teeth.	2
Dr. Urbankova is the epitome of preventative dental medicine. Since my first visit, she educated me on the multiple factors that play into dental health, including proper routine, products, and visits. Never before has a dentist educated me more and opened  my eyes to the importance of good dentition. She, along with her whole dental staff were wonderfully accommodating with my very busy schedule and often stayed after hours to finish the work. I would recommend Dr. Urban...	2

excellent"	2
"Dr. Urbankova is extremely knowledgeable and efficient in her work.  I was having pain in a tooth that had a filling done 20 years ago which doctors have told me should go for a root canal. I came in to see Dr. U who explained to me how avoiding a root canal would help protect and keep my tooth. There were three fractures on the tooth that Dr. Urbankova discovered when she started working, which she sealed and covered. Now, my tooth is stronger, and no root canal!!!

very pleasant and informative	2
I am comfortable here and receive what I consider the best of care!  They really do care about you, the patient!	2
Dr Urbankova is the best	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Urbankova's for several years now and I've never encountered a more passionate dentist in my life. Her kind, professional and sweet demeanor is comforting. I know she has nothing but my mouths best interest at heart and I trust her intelligence and skills without question. I adore the way she ensures I understand everything entailing the care of my teeth and there's no one else I will entrust the care of my dental health to. I am so grateful that we met.	2
Dr Urbankova truly cares about her patients and their dental health.  She uses innovative techniques to help preserve your teeth.  :)	2
Dr Urbankova saw my condition after an apiceoctomy, which I needed after a failed root canal. I came into the office in such pain and discomfort after this procedure done in another office.  Dr. Urbankova suggested she use the laser on me in a procedure called biostim, which has helped me so much. It was the help I needed! I sat for about an hour or so with laser treatment and my face swelling went down, my pain was relieved tremendously, and finally I could laugh again. ...	2
She is extremely knowledgable and informative.  I was very satisfied and would highly recommend!	2
So far so good . Friendly staff as well.	2
I love the approach of Dr Urbankova to preserve teeth as much as possible without any invasive procedures. I would highly recommend! A wonderful and very professional approach to patients.	2
Dr. Urbankova saved my teeth from requiring root canals, extending their life significantly	2
"My experience is one of the most highly recommended, there is such care and communication between Dr. Urbankova and her patients. I have never met a dentist that would email me back at 10pm if i have a problem and she has done it several times. That shows there is a caring to preserve my teeth and a dedication to getting my mouth back to health. The office is beautiful, clean and friendly. 
I totally recommend Preserve Your Teeth and Dr. Alice Urbankova is so friendly and..."	2
Dr Urbankova explains the treatment plan and how it improves your oral health.  She is very serious about prevention, guarding against serious problems that will occur in the future.  She uses excellent skills to address optimum teeth and gum health	2
The whole staff is fantastic and everything is always explained in detail	2
I've been a patient here for years, and have always received excellent care and comfort.	2
Took the time to fully explain everything and gave me my smile back! :)	2
I come here for cleanings, fillings and all dental proceedures. Dr. Urbankova and Dr. Steve E are great. They do fantastic work on my teeth. My dental history hasnt always been stellar but they are helping to correct years of neglect!	2
"Always a great experience, with great dentist and hygenist. Very caring, informative, and takes the time to explain and do what is necessary to prevent invasive surgeries later on.
Not to many dentist out there who practice dentistry this way. Love them!!!

Very patient. The Dentist explains everything and makes the patient feel comfortable. Everyone is so nice!!!	2
"Dr. Urbankova brings state of the art technology to her craft. Her attention to detail is remarkable in tooth reconstruction. She is a leading practitioner in tooth reconstruction and preservation and it won't be before long before many in her field 
begin to follow her example."	2
Can always rely on the service. No complaints at all.	2
Saved two teeth from root canal!	2
"Have been a patient for 10 years and always have a positive experience, ""doctor gets me out of deep waters"" with her creative solutions!"	2
I have to say, coming to see my dentist, Alice Urbankova, is one of my smartest decision I've made in my life. Not only she saved one of my deep cavity tooth but also my wisdom tooth, Before I came to Dr. Urbankova, I was told I need to remove both of my #15 molar tooth and the wisdom tooth. I was even told nothing can be done to save these teeth. But, nothing after seeing Dr. Urbankova. She saved both of teeth and done a beautiful job on them. It's like a miracle to have...	2
I was nervous at first because I had never had a cavity before but thanks to Dr.Urbankova I felt more comfortable. 10/10 would recommend.	2
this dentist is the absolute worst. Has done work on my teeth, and never fixed the problem,actually making it worse and he does not even seem to care. Office staff is atrocious. Now going to new dentist and much happier. Dr Grabers partner, who I have seen also, is just as bad. Just dont go  	0
Dr. Dechavez is very pleasant and took his time attending to my needs.  He reviewed the x-ray that I brought with me from another dentist's office but needed to take some more for clearer understanding of my problem.  He took the time to explain to my my options and what was his professional opinion.   Unfortunately, I need to see a specialist for a difficult root canal but I would recommend Dr. Dechavez.	2
Came to Dr. Silverstein for a cleaning and check-up.  Appointment process was very easy and there was no wait when I arrived.  Kim, the dental hygenist, is very friendly and very patient when performing the cleaning.  I have not been to the dentist in a while and I expected it to be painful but it wasn't at all!  Dr. Silverstein took his time listening to my concerns and explaining what he was doing.  All in all, it was a great experience - easy, efficient, and effective.	2
I've been a patient for over 20 years. That says it all.	1

Dr. Silverstein has been my family dentist for a number of years...We find him to be extremely capable and conscientious.  He always places patient care and comfort above all!

I just retired and my permanent upper bridge had fallen out once again!-Dr. Silverstein is the Best and I've been to nearly 20 Dentists in my 67 years.

lovely, pain free.	2
I broke my front tooth when I was 11years old and had been putting off fixing it for years since it hurt so badly last time, but I really wanted it redone for my wedding.  Dr. Stange talked to me extensively about his plan to make it look natural and the process pain free.  I was extremely nervous, but he did not let me down.  My tooth looks perfect and matches my other front tooth exactly and no pain!  Wonderful office and staff- highly recommend!	2
Dr. Moussa is a skilled dentist and has an excellent bedside manner. Before and during my tooth extraction, he and his staff were attentive to my concerns, welcomed my questions, and guided me through each step of the procedure. I am glad I chose Dr. Moussa instead of a traditional dentist.	2

everyone here makes you feel so comfortable and welcomed. the doctor was very understanding about my fears. the doctor did everything he could to assure me i was in good hands. i personally recommend him to anyone who has a really big fear of the dentist. he acted more as a friend then a dentist	2
Consultation was free.... doctors and staff are all in making your experience pleasant. Your choice on where you go for dental service but I choice to go back and have the procedure done there. What we talked about during the consultation made sense and was offered a feasible pay schedule.	2

I have been going to Dr. Moussa since 2007, and I'm proud to call him not only my dentist, but also my friend. We are fortunate to have him in our community!"	2
Dr. Moussa is a very talented, creative, innovative, and skilled dentist. He goes out of his way to Provide his patients the best possible experience. He is always learning, investing, and sometimes teaching about the latest innovative dental technologies so he can provide the best possible care for his patients. I’ve taken advantage of both CEREC and LANAP technology he provided my to ensure perfect fitting crowns and periodontal health. He is also a great guy and has become a true friend. 	2
Amazing Dentist, Amazing work! I never thought I would trust someone again to touch my teeth but, I am so glad I found this great office.

I cannot recommend this office enough! As an actor and model, my smile is super important so I would not entrust its care to just anyone! A+	2
SO CALMING!! So friendly. Everyone in the office has a lovely demeanor. Nothing feels like a trip to the dentist. Went in for my first visit, felt instantly at ease. The whole staff leaves you feeling wonderfully taken care of.  Perfect dentistry, THE BEST imaging technology (3D X-rays?!?), GO TO THIS DENTIST! Highly recommended for those wary of dental visits. My friend was extremely dentist-phobic and loves it here.	2
"Dr. Mousse and staff are absolutely amazing. It’s very rare when you can walk into a dental office and feel like everything is going to be ok but some how they make you feel safe. 

They provide A+ Service from the minute you walk in the door till it’s time to leave. Everyone there is so kind, patient and gentle. They go over every single process, understanding to any anxiety you might have about dentist office in general. 

I’m very blessed to have them for my dental care & you will be too!"	2
I had a have a tooth removed because of a cyst.  Needless to say, I was nervous about the procedure.  I felt zero pain during and after the procedure.  Amazing work.	2
After not having visited a dentist in over a decade, I had a bit of work to be done. My teeth were in good shape considering, but I've been in and out of the chair a few times now in order to accomplish the list of procedures I require. I was terrified at first, but Dr. Moussa and the team have been making this process as comfortable as possible and have explained every step clearly. Highly recommend this place to anyone who's fearful, holistic, sensitive, or just wants a great experience.	2
Dr. Moussa is the best dentist in New York. Nobody better!	2
Very friendly and professional staff.	2
They are really amazing   Dr Moussa did a really beautiful work with crowns for me !!  Same for Mimi with bleaching	2
Very positive experience with my son today, he is only 4 and had cavity.  Dr Moussa and his assistant Justine used a laser.  It was quick and painless.  They were lovely to my son and put him at ease right away.  I highly recommend Dr. Moussa.	2
As a first time patient, I came to Montclair Dental Spa for a cleaning.  The experience was relaxing and pain free.  The hygienist was very thorough and it was the best cleaning I ever had!  Dr. Moussa was very professional and nice as he explained the issues with my teeth in a no pressure manner.  I highly recommend Dr. Moussa, and Montclair Dental Spa for a great dental experience.  I am happy to remain a patient. 	2
Dr. Moussa is probably the best dentist in New York.   He's always up to date with the latest cutting-edge technologies and has all the most modern, state-of-the-art equipment.  By his recommendation, he performed the LANAP procedure on my gums in his office.  He literately saved my teeth! This procedure is hands down better than the old way (scalpel).  Besides that, he's quite personable, gentle, and sensitive to your needs.  You won't find a better dentist!! My highest recommendation !!!	2
Dr. Moussa is a wonderful caring dentist.   He once stayed unil 10 pm working on my mouth because I had several issues going on at once.  Thanks to him my mouth is better than it has ever been.  I am glad I found him.  	2
 A patient for over 8 years, he steadily invested in his practice and providing outstanding service to his clients. He is knowledgeable, interested in patient concerns, resourceful and technologically forward thinking. His gentle, caring demeanor shines through even when sharing a difficult diagnosis or treatment plan. He also selflessly makes referrals and encourages patients to seek specialists best suited to their needs. He has a highly skilled team committed to excellent patient experience. 	2
Always a positive experience! 	2
I have had nothing but positive experience with Dr Margariti. I?ve recommended her to friends and family already. She will treat your conditions the write way not just do the procedure that pays the most. I went to 2 dentists before her they said I needed a root canal but she said I didn?t need it and saved me money as well as the life of my tooth. I must say you can never find a dentist like that in Brooklyn. If you are looking for a dental doctor you will not find one better then her.	2
I highly recommend this place. I was so nervous by going there but the staff was so great and friendly they made me feel so comfortable. Dr Dubinsky was so informative and patient. Overall great experience 	2
An awesome dental experience.  For starters, the staff was very friendly and professional. I had a hygienist Erica, who made the entire visit comfortable and relaxing, paused to answer all of my questions thoroughly.  I usually don't have good things to say about a dental visit, but this is the exception.  Thanks again	2
Knowledgeable, caring, and gentle. I also overheard how good she was with children who came into the office. She is surrounded by equally caring and competent staff.	2
"I absolutely in love with this Dr.!!! 
He is very professional and dedicated to his work.
Very short waiting time. You are in and out of his office with excellent work done. !!!

Have you ever been to a dentist office and don't want to leave?  Dr. Boyd and his staff are beyond excellent. As a new patient, I walked into the office and there was Clara and another employee both so welcoming and affectionate.  They make you feel very comfortable. Once I went beyond the reception area and met Dr. Boyd, I knew I was in the right place.  Dr. Boyd is very pleasant, professional, caring, comforting and an expert at his job.  His warm smile assures you that you are in great hands.	2
Dr. Menon has been my dentist for many years.  She and her staff take wonderful care of the patients which was essential to me because I had a bad experience with another dentist before I started going to Dr. Menon.  I explained the situation at my first appointment with her and she completely understood my nerves, put me at ease and did a great job on my teeth.  So I've been happily going back ever since!  	2
What started off as a professional visit almost 20 years ago, has developed into a warm friendly relationship between Dr. Menon and me and my wife. Dr. Menon is a warm, caring human being who places the individual needs above any other.. She has the ability to put at ease any nervous patient. It has been a pleasure to be associated with her.	2
"Dr Pinali is one of the best dentists I have got treatment from. I have been seeing her since 2001 and it is consistent and professional treatments with a touch of homeliness. She has given correct advises to ensure the dental health is under check and any anticipated dental work gets addressed in advance.
I would highly recommend Dr Pinali for any dental treatments as all my family are her patients for more than a decade now. Thank you doctor!"	2
Dr. Menon is very professional with excellent patient care. We switched my daughter's dentist to Dr. Menon after a bad experience with another dentist and in just two trips she now looks forward to waiting her turn and checking her teeth. She's three. I think that displays how gentle and attentive Dr. Menon is, especially with children.	2
Dr. Menon and her staff are wonderful! I have been to many dentists never being satisfied and after my visit today I know I found my and my family's dentist for life! Dr. Menon is amazing!	2
I have been a patient for Dr. Menon for almost 15 years. She takes great interest and care- both personally and professionally.  She takes strong interest in patients and their families.  I appreciate the personal touch in she has- very caring and welcoming.  Thanks to her my teeth have never been in better shape. 	2
Have know Dr Menon from 15 yrs now for our family and also our 15 yr old special need son. she is a wonderful person and extremely good at her work. Always explains everything very well is open minded and respects patients decision. Staff is extremely good and office environment is very friendly. I had no problems ever taking our son to her. 	2

Dr.Menon is one of the best doctor I had ever seen.Dhe is very good at diagnosis and clearly explains about the treatment plans. Very gentle in doing the procedures. 	2
I have been a patient of Dr.Menon's for almost 11 years now and everytime I go Dr.Menon and the staff are so wonderful and they assist me with any of my dental problems. Soon I will get my braces and I'm not afraid of getting them because I know Dr.Menon will do a great job. I would recommend to anyone who needs a good dentist, just go to Smiles 'R' Us	2
Our family visits Dr Menon for over a year now and we feel that she is extremely knowledgeable about the dental problems. Our visits are pleasant with a less waiting time.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Menon for over 15 years and highly recommend her services to anyone wanting to benefit from first class dental care. Dr. Menon provides personal attention to her patients and has done extensive work on restoring my teeth to its current state. I have had dental implants and teeth filings done over the years and have never encountered an issue. Dr. Menon provides expert advise on the work needed to restore your dental hygiene. 	2
"Dr. Pinali Menon is the best dentist I have ever had. I have moved out of NJ for years now but I continue going to her as she is thorough, really understands the patient's issues and takes the time to explain the condition in detail. She provides actionable plans to remedy the situation.
"	2
One can hardly say that the visit to the dentist was delightful, but that was my experience at Smiles 'R' Us. Dr. Menon was very helpful to any questions I had and very clear about what she was doing during the entire session. She clearly cares for her patients, and it shows. After having tried a few other dentists in the area, I can confidently say that after my visit with Dr. Menon, I know she will be my primary dentist from now on. My only regret is not seeing her sooner!	2
Dr.Menon has a strong fund of knowledge, exceptional skills and  many years experience. Exceptional interpersonal skills and very amiable. 	2
Dr Vargas and staff are wonderful, friendly & professionals.  Excellent Dentist & staffh	2
I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Vargas and the entire staff.  I was so nervous and he was sure to explain everything to me.  He partnered with an awesome oral surgeon and together the two of them made me look and feel amazing with minimal inconvenience to my career and life.  Dr. Vargas is an artist.  He gave me several digital pictures to choose from for the finished result so I knew ahead of time.  I now look exactly like what he showed me digitally.  I highly recommend him and I appreciate EVERYTHING he has done for me.  Thank you so much Dr. Vargas	2
Excellent dentist.  Staff is professional and friendly.  Office is immaculate.  I highly recommend.  	2
I can't say enough about Dr Vargas, Dr O'Shaughnessy and the entire staff here.  Whether it is a routine cleaning or an issue with a tooth, scheduling is always a priority to them -a refreshing change from most doctors or dentists these days.  Dr. Vargas is knowledgeable, personable and does his best to make sure dental visits are as stress free as possible.  His support staff is top notch - personable, concerned and always professional.  I would highly recommend this practice to anyone searching for an office where you are a person and not just another patient!	2
I was referred to him by another dentist in the family. Dr. Vargas is EXCELLENT at what he does!! 	2
"I never had anything good to say about a dentist or a dentist to say it about. Nothing against dentists, but they all pretty much suck.  Except for Dr. Vargas.  Usually, you sit in the chair and it’s pretty unpleasant. Here, it isn’t that bad.
True story: the Hygienist said she could tell I flossed.  Yup, shame-free dentistry! Simple, but brilliant. 

What can I say?  It’s still the dentist, but it doesn’t suck anywhere near as bad as the rest of them.  Not even close."	1
"Excellent 

Always exactly what you want from a great doctor "	2
My family and I have all moved to Chappaqua Smiles and have been very satisfied with our experience.

Have recommended the practice to friends.	2
Wonderful staff and very accommodating. Dr. Vargas is a great dentist!	2

My husband and I have seen Dr. Gajjar for years and loved his friendly demeanor and thorough appointments (that are always quick and easy!). After we had our son, we brought him here and were so struck by how kind and patient he was despite our son crying and being scared.

When I visit the dentist, and I don't know what the situation is, she does. When I do know the situation, she already has the solution. She is accurate in both deciding what the situaiton  is and she solves it just as well. The job is done painless and perfectly, and I never doubt her. I have been visiting her for years and plan to continue in doing so.	2
over the years,thanks to the doctor, l can eat meat and vegetables in any kind of cooking.	2
"Dr. Bogomolny is our family dentist for the last 9 years. Very responsive and accommodating for any problems we have. Our kids are living far away and still try to come and see her. Once I had a tooth ache when visiting California, called her on the weekend, and got the prescription for pain medication promptly. Dr. Bogomolny is just great.

"Dr Mutreja is the reason I am alive today. His course of treatment literally saved my life. 
You will not find a finer cardiologist and trust in him is well placed."	2
Dr. Muttreja takes a sincere interest in his patients, never rushing through a visit and always considering the whole person and not just the symptoms. He is able to quickly assess and understand the nature of the visit. I have great confidence in him. 	2
Doctor Muttreja is the best.   He has a great personality & he really cares about his patients.  He makes you feel comfortable, he listens to you and lets you ask questions.  He calls you back and is very knowledgeable.  This doctor has saved my life and I thank God for putting him in my life.  In this day and age doctors like this are hard to find.  	2
"Loved him, he was pleasant, explained things that I understood. 



"	2
Dr. Stever is a phenomenal cardiologist.  He is a good listener and very concerned about his patients.  I had intense radiation years ago and heart disease runs in my family.  Dr. Stever has been following me for years.  My parents cardiologist told me there was nothing wrong with my heart because the skin looked okay.  How's that for a cardiologist? Different strokes for different folks.  My parents liked their doctor.  I trust Dr. Stever.  I will never leave his practice.	2
Dr. Stever is an absolute nightmare.  Our dad complained of chest pains and was dismissed, and he is is cardiologist.   Its unbelievable to hsve no ethics. Later our father had a heart attack and we reached out to him with no response.   Our father needs double bypass and Dr. Stever still a no show or response to our numberous phone messages.   Complete negligence.   If you value your life stay away.  Needless to say we will never let him treat anyone.  	0
Excellent doctor. Caring and very knowledgeable. 	2
Great	2
I first met Dr. Cusnir 10 years ago following a TIA.  Since then , he has controlled my hypertension and Atrial Fib. He displays a genuine interest in me, so that I look forward to my appointments. I am a tough critic of physicians, being a retired RN with 20 years supervisory experiences in local hospitals. His staff is excellent.	2
Absolutely amazing!! Great doctor and his staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. Highly recommend it 	2
I was there the last 2 days on the 28th for an echo and on the 29th for a stress test, while I didn't see see Dr. Cusnir on either of those days; his staff was more than qualified to handle my needs. Dr. Cusnir has assembled a very good group of professionals.  	2
Dr. Cusnir is so important to me. An Angel in disguise  I met him at Westside Hospital on Sunday in October in the ER. I was diagnosed with MVD. And he has made me comfortable with this disease by explaining and he has always returned my call the same day. Never wait long. But he treats the patient and the family. I am only 47, he calls me his baby patient. This man has shown that he really cares about his patients and he's a pretty cool dad. 	2
i tell everyone what a fine doctor Dr. Cusnir is how he pays attention to your problems, get you the right treatment	2
very likely. Dr Cusnir is excellent doctor.	2

HIS BED SIDE MANNER IS ONE OF THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN 
HE CARES ABOUT HIS PATIENTS
AND IS RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST IN FLORIDA
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM"	2
"Dr. Cusnir is a most excellent doctor and one I have utter trust in.  He is very caring and knowledge in his medical practice.  I have been around Dr. Cusnir at FMC where I work and when it came time for me to seek a cardio workup, there was no question as to who I would choose to be my ""heart doctor"".  His staff are very friendly and efficient and it is a pleasure to visit his office."	2
"Definitely would recommend him to others.
"	2
If you have always dreamed of having a doctor in the family here he is.  At least that how Dr. Cusnir and his experienced staff make you feel.  Top notch from top down.	2
Love Dr. Cusnir and the office!  Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, considerate...I could go on and on. I am immensely grateful for the care and support I receive from this practice. 	2
I have been seeing Dr. Cusnir for the past year.  I have a long cardiovascular history and when I moved into the area he was highly recommended.  I find him to be friendly, concerned, and knows his stuff. The staff is courteous and the wait is never long.  The office is always clean and comfortable.	2
Dr. Cusnir is the best and most caring Cardiologist I have ever known. Also his staff are extremely friendly and proficient. You will never regret selecting Dr. Cusnir and the Health and Heart institute for you Cardiac care.	2

Brian Landsman	2
I've been seeing Dr. Cusnir since 2008.  Besides being an outstanding cardiologist, he has become like a friend to me.  He is very attentive to my needs, honest in his assessments, and always cheerful and optimistic about my health.  	2
I did not like this guy's bedside manner.  He does seem knowledgable of his practice, but was not very compassionate of my special needs, which are not cardiac related.  	0
Dr. Cusnir is the best!  He is thorough, gives you time to ask questions and explains things, and puts you at ease. 	2
Great doctor. Friendly, informative takes questions and gives understanding answers. Good bed side manners. 	2
Very easy to talk to him	2
Dr. Henry Cusnir, appears to me like a person, who came into the world for taking care of the hurting people. He behaves like a doctor should, I am not easily pleased, find fault with many healthcare physicians prior to  him. He made me feel cared for, and I'm a 100% satisfied patient. He is a special professional healthcare provider.  	2
Dr Cusnir has a great bedside manner. He makes you feel comfortable and at ease. He listens and explains your case. He is complimentary and courteous. He is an asset to the field of Cardiology.	2
very caring and took his time explaining everything. Dr Brezing referred Dr. Cusnir and my husband and I are very happy to have him as my husbands cardiologist. Extremely satisfied and would definitely recommend him to others	2
Dr. Cusnir was outstanding in every way for me. First he listened really well. Next he did some preliminary analysis and communicated back to me what he thought was going on. My cathiderization went very smoothly. Dr. Cusnir and his team performed a relatively painless procedure which showed what we needed to know and explained what was going on. I feel really good about it, and would recommend Dr. Cusiner enthusiastically!	2
" it was my first appt , it was ok talking to the DR , was very comfortable , will write another review after my next appt.

thank you"	2
"I would definitely recommend Dr. Cusinir. He is courteous and personable, which is so important when dealing with matters of the heart. A doctor's visit can be unnerving otherwise. Dr. Cusinir is what I would describe as an ""everyman's doctor"". "	2
"Both my husband and I love Dr. Cusnir. He is very knowledgeable in his field of Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology. He helped my husband by successfully placing a stent in an artery that other cardiologists would not even try after my husbands heart attack. 
Dr. Cusnir is open and honest and tells you like he sees it. He cares about you and listens to what you say and NEVER rushes you during your appointment. We are grateful that we were recommended to him and tell everyone about him.  "	2
Dr. Cusnir is my cardiologist and he has always demonstrated the height of professionalism - incredible  knowledge, wonderful understanding of my case history, exceptionally positive approach to my needs especially since my heart attack 5 months ago, and believe it or not - always on time & never having me wait excessively (except for once after an emergency when he apologized profusely).  A really good guy with a great smile! You know, it's always good when your doctor greets you with a smile.	2
Dr. Cusnir is the best cardiologist I have seen, and he also saved my life. He is extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, and listens to your concerns. He has a passion for his profession and you easily see that when you are in his presence. He also is responsive to his patients and has a great ease and personality. You will be in great hands!	2
  I have several doctors in the past. Dr Cusnir is a doctor that is soft spoken and sometimes humorous. My visits there have been informative and comforting. Its a 45 minute ride for me but its worth it to go to a great Doctor. I feel very confident in him. After a couple of visits my husband started to go to him also.	2
He was so thorough with my health problems great bedside manner , efficient staff as well , it took 2 months for appt but well worth the wait 	2
Routine...always great to see Dr Huneycutt!	2
Him and his associate were very nice and informative. I would recommend him to anyone!! The only thing was my chart says due to alcohol intake which is few and far between for me. There has to be another reason which I’m reading upon and calling my UHC case nurse to help me figure out how to lower.	2
My visit was very good. Dr. Honeycutt was very nice and listened to my concerns. Dr. Honeycutt and his staff were very nice and helpful.	2
I really liked Dr Huneycutt because mostly his knowledge of whole food plant based nutrition and reversing heart disease. To my knowledge he is the only Cardiologist in Middle Tennessee who is aware of the benefits of eating WFPB.	2
Dr.  Huneycutt is very attentive to my needs and has my full faith and trust he will care for me and my health. I had a very productive visit with good news concerning my heart. He right away made an appointment for me to look into my weight loss the very next day.	2
Dr. Huneycutt is intelligent, kind and caring. He listens to me and explains things to my understanding.	2

"I have been going to heart Doctors since 1993.  I have had 3 Doctors for my heart.
Dr. Huneycutt is by far the best Heart Doctor I have met.  Not only is he very smart but he is compassionate.  He does not try to rush your through the exam.  Very through and listens to all your questions. He far better than any 5 star rating."	2
I've been a patient of Dr Huneycutt for six years. He's hands down one of the best! He's knowledgeable, compassionate, and on top of his game! 	2
I love Dr. H., He is a Compassionate caring doctor! He takes time with patients. Great man. I highly recommend! 	2
Never rushed the visit .Listens attentively . Makes you feel heard.	1
Had a great experience as a new patient.  Very knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions and take care of my issue.  Will definitely see him in the future if needed.  His NP, Charlotte, is an asset as well.	2
He listened to my symptoms (I did not look to be in distress) and  scheduled a cardiac cath proceedure.  I received a stent.  Dr Huneycut was on the floor when I was taken to my room.  He came by and check on me.  I couldn't ask for better care	2
He is a great cardiologist. He is a very caring person. He takes time to also hear you when you speak. When you have a test ordered, he right on top of the report. He whole staff is wonderful. 	2
"I can;t even compare Dr. Huneyc
utt with any other doctor...he is the best..."	1
Dr Huneycutt and staff are hands down exceptional. They always have a welcoming smile on their face and really care about me. I would highly recommend Dr Huneycutt to anyone.  	2
Dr Honneycutt is someone who truly cares and listens to what you have to say.  He is thorough I leave knowing I'm taken care of.	2
Dr. Huneycutt is awesome!! Wonderful diagnostician!! I have and will continue to recommend him!! 	2
This was the only time the only visit the only appointment that I've ever had where the amount of time waiting for an x-ray the blood test and then the examination took 5 hours to do I I don't know if that's normal but there was quite a few people complaining about it the amount of time for the X-ray and for the blood test was way too long this has never happened to me before I think Centennial hospital and Dr Honeycut are the finest in any Hospital situation the care you get the kindness all 	1
My husband was looking for a cardiologist as our cardiologist passed away. My husband wanted a cardiologist like he had before who was compassionate, understanding, kind, someone who listened to him, treated him like a person, and someone he could call to talk to. Wow didn't think he would find another wonderful, compassionate, kind, cardiologist! Dr. Honeycutt goes above and beyond! Dr. Honeycutt is one of a kind! Dr. Honeycutt sits, listens and observes then interacts with a good kind heart! 	2
Dr Huneycutt takes the time to understand my concerns and to address issues with my overall health as well as my heart health	2
Outstanding Doctor who sincerely cares about his patients.	2
Dr. Hunnicutt is a caring person, who gives one plenty of time to discuss one's concerns.	2
"The first time I met Doctor H, I asked if he could help me manage my heart issues.  He said, “Absolutely!”  He has for years now.  I do and will continue to trust him with my life.

I've been seeing Dr. Huneycutt ever since moving to Tennessee in 2011. He is truly a professional.  His knowledge and ability to clearly explain what is going on is exceptional.

Dr Honeycutt is the best doctor ever. He is professional and caring and I trust him with my heart health!	2
Dr. Huneycutt is everything you hope to find in a physician and cardiologist.  I never feel rushed, he is explains everything at an understandable level, interested in you as a person and he is young enough that hopefully he won't be retiring when I need him most.	2

He always takes the time to listen to your concerns about anything that is on your mind. I LOVE his way of making you feel at ease so that you will open up about what is bothering you. Pick Dr.David I promise you , you will never regret your               decision.  I would recommend Dr. Huneycutt  to anyone that needs a Heart specialist that can be trusted to shoot straight .	2

Dr. Bradley is thorough, well trained and cares tremendously about his patients and their well-being. My mother loves him and is comfortable with asking him any question pertaining to her health and care. I would definitely recommend him if you are seeking a World Class Cardiologist that has a gentle side.	2
"personable & knowledgeable, I couldn't ask for better service
AAAA+++ "	2
I was referred to Dr. Bradley by my surgeon,and he explained the results of my previous EKG, took a new one, and he calmed my fears by explaining the differences  and Told my surgeon that it was safe to proceed with the surgery. He was informative and reassuring with an engaging sense of humor. 	2
My husband's primary doctor referred us after we expressed some disappointment with the Cardiologist he had seen while in the hospital rehab.  We were both nervous about the visit.  We found the office staff, nurse and Dr. Bradley to be fantastic!  Extremely caring, took time to explain future tests to us, answered questions and gave both of us a sense of trust in the  practice.  I can't say enough positive about our first experience with this practice.  	2
I was referred to Dr Brady by my primary Dr.  My heart health could not be in better hands. The one thing that impressed me the most is that at the end of each visit he gave me a hand written summary of the visit, his findings, and plan of action.....Thank you Dr. Brady	2
I attended my first appointment with Dr. Bradley today at the Wynnewood Office. The front desk staff were amazing and very welcoming. The nurse Erin was fabulous, sweet and patient when asking me questions about my symptoms. Dr. Bradley is very knowledgeable and I appreciated the time he spent with me reviewing the heart and discussing my options for next steps. Dr. Bradley is very personable and his staff are wonderful. Thank you! 	2
Dr Bradley makes you very comfortable and explains things in simple English but will keep pushing until he gets answers. Even though my stress test came back normal he knew something was wrong and it turned out I had a 99% blockage. The man saved my life. 	2
He's a friendly cardiologist that takes the time to review my issues and make good plans for my health. 	2
Dr.Bradley and his staff are excellent! I would definitely recommend him if your looking for a Cardiologist.	2
Dr. Bradley was knowledgeable and caring. I was so fearful after having been given an unexpected referral to a Cardiologist. He eased my worries immediately and started making a plan for my evaluation.  I felt supported and not judged. I appreciated the friendliness of his office staff and Nurse Practitioner. I feel more confident to return to my follow up appointment in January.	2
Dear Dr. Jason Bradley, you are the best cardiologist, you have a wonderful staff; Jeff H, Erin H, Sharon R, Lauren P, Anna N, Toni M, and Janet C.  My experience felt like  having my own private nurse and ultimate best care. Your facility is top notch.   	2
I was in and out of the hospital every other month because of problems with my heart and high blood pressure. Dr. Bradley have blown me away with his care. He is super friendly and personable. He is never in a hurry. He sit down and talk to you like a friend. Even though he's my cardiologist I talk to him about everything, even my problems with other doctors. He allows me to vent and then help.  I wish he could be my primary doctor. 5 stars are not enough for he and his staff. They're 10 stars!!	2
Let me start by saying I've seen a lot of doctors. Many give you the worst case scenerio and terrify you. I had my first appointment with Dr. Bradley and he put me at ease, was knowledgeable, proactive and I left feeling I'd found the perfect heart doctor! You will not regret seeing this doctor. 	2
Is it really possible these days to have a pleasant and on time doctor visit?  Visiting Dr Bradley was not your typical medical visit.   The back room was informed, friendly, and acted as if they enjoyed their jobs.  WOW!  Dr Bradley explained his findings so a lay person could understand.  Was thorough, pleasant and on time!  Great experience!	2
Kind, responsive & courteous	2
The staff n doctor are so friendly and knowledgeable. Made me feel real comfortable and relaxed. Hopefully I stay healthy but if not will be back.	2
This was one of my best experience in a doctor's office. The front office greeted me right away and the two technicians, Erin and Mallory were the  best. They put me at ease right away and during the examination maintained such a professional but friendly environment. I was a bit nervous and worried but I relaxed right away and left the exam room feeling pretty good even though I had to wait for the results. Kudos to Erin and Mallory. Love you guys and Thank youse!!	2
I just had my first visit with Dr Bradley and from the moment I walked into the office I was impressed. His front office colleagues were so friendly. The back office nurse called me back almost immediately. He was incredibly engaged in our conversation. I did not feel rushed. He answered all of my questions and took great notes. I feel so at ease knowing I found a phenomenal doctor less then 5 miles from my house! I highly recommend. 	2

Dr. Bradley is caring, professional, courteous, patient. He spends time explaining and answering questions. You never feel rushed.	2
Dr. Bradley is very thorough, and is a great listener. Additionally is very up to date on the newest medical trends and treatment. I especially love that he reviews all the facts in the exam room with me of my prior visits for comparison purposes and to determine the outcomes and current effectiveness of prescribed treatments. He has excellent follow through skills and calls me in a  timey manner with results or answers to questions, etc. His front office team is also extremely efficient.	2
IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO A CARDIOLOGIST, DR. JASON BRADLEY IS THE MAN. HE'S PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH AND CARING. GIVES  WRITTEN NOTES FOR ABSENT MINDED PATIENTS LIKE ME. CAN'T THANK DR. GREGORY ENOUGHT FOR HER FORSIGHT IN RECOMMENDING HIM TO ME.	2

Always professional and informative.  Answers all questions completely and I have total confidence in him as my Heart Doctor.	2
"Very very detailed. I was able to understand everything. It was like talking to an old friend about a movie or baseball.
I would highly recommend Dr Jason Bradley.
Very concerned and caring man.
Thank you Sir for handling me with care and being so personable."	2
"Dr Bradley is a very professional and thoughtful doctor who will give you the best care and
advise he can give you to help your problematic heart symptoms.  There isn't enough space here to list all of his good qualities.  He is attentive to all of your questions and will make you feel good after visiting him."	2
Affable and efficient but willing to answer every question. 	2
I highly recommend this cardiologist.  Dr.  Jason Bradley is a diligent, skilled, and caring physician.  His staff have always been very kind and helpful as well.  Every single appointment has always run on time, I have never waited more than 5 minutes.  Also, all of my calls placed have always been returned very quickly. His office runs very smoothly and should be the model for other doctor's offices.  In summary, I would recommend Dr. Bradley to any family member or friend of mine.	2
Dr. Bradley takes his time and makes you feel as if he really cares about you and your health and he listens.	2
I found Dr Bradley as I was visiting my back surgeon who was next door.  I was having no problems but wanted to be checked out due to my age. (67)  He was kind and polite.  He called me when he was supposed to call and I feel secure with him as now, my cardiologist.  I especially like his manner: he is direct and to the point without being brusque.  He listens and answers questions in plain language.  My favorite attribute is that he seems like a regular guy and not pompous and arrogant.	2
Dr.Bradley takes your health very seriously. He has a knack for getting you to tell him precisely what is going on with your health. He remembers everything regarding your health. Office staff is great, appointments on time. I don't stay with a physician if I don't feel 100% pleased, and I'm an RN, so I can figure it out pretty well.	2
"Dr. Bradley is knowledgeable, thorough and compassionate. He spends time with you, listens to your concerns and answers any questions you have. I appreciate that he is prompt in returning phone calls and easily contacted if needed. I would highly recommend Dr. Bradley to my family and friends. As someone in the medical profession that works in a critical care setting, I have met and worked with many cardiologists. Dr. Bradley is an exceptional doctor! 
The office staff is friendly and kind. "	2
Always positive experience with this doctors. Patient and willing to take time to answer questions and concerns.	2
I have never written an online review on anything. I trust Dr. Jason Bradley with the lives of those most precious to me;  my husband, mother, brother, two brothers in law and a family friend. His compassion, empathy, sincerity are just the beginning of why I and my family trust him implicitly.   Dr. Jason Bradley is incredibly intelligent and personally invested in his one on one patient care, he is very assuring and careful when reviewing all options of treatment. I highly recommend him.	2
I’m 64 years old and have been a patient of Dr. Zarrella for almost 2 years. Feel very fortunate to be under his care. He represents a unique combination of extremely high professional competence and excellent communications. He is insightful, thorough & empathetic while explaining things clearly and involving you in the decision process. Highly recommend him!	2
Very good person.	2
"Dr Zarella is truly s wonderful doctor and person. He has taken care of my93 year old dad for last few years and we adore him. Kind, professional, caring and so so smart! 
We cannot say enough kind words for such a Tremendous doctor."	2
I became Dr. Zarrella's patient last year.  I feel that I am in confident--as well as--more than  capable hands.  He is a treasure to the practice.  He is frank, open, and honest.  Not to mention young--as I will be seeing the cardiologist for the rest of my life.  He makes you feel comfortable as a patient.  I am fortunate to have found him.  I would recommend him to others...very satisfied with him--as well as his colleagues.	2
Prompt, thorough, returns calls 	1
I needed an appointment as soon as possible and was seen promptly and efficiently.	2
"I've been a patient of Dr. Herod's for several years now since acquiring a pacemaker.
He is personally warm, attentive, and thoroughly informed."	2
Dr Herod and his staff are very professional.  The greet us with a smile and make us feel important.  They never rush us or make us feel like we need to hurry.  That's a big deal!	2
I appreciated the fact Dr. Herod listened to me carefully and responded to my concerns.  He clarified some medication issues that was helpful.  I look forward to my follow-up visit and the information gleaned from wearing the monitor.  Yes, I would recommend him to others.	2
My experience has been very positive with Dr. Herod	2
Dr. Herod takes the time to explain any issues  or changes in treatment. You don't feel rushed and he listens to you. I feel in good hands under his care!	2
Dr. Herod, is a excellent example of a doctor who cares!	2
Very attentive Doctors and a great staff! Never a wait, always feel great when I leave their office. 	2
Professional, courteous and efficient 	2
Always very helpful, listens and takes into consideration my comments, questions and concerns.  A good doctor in a top notch professional practice.	2
I have been pleased with the straight forward discussions of my cardiac issues and their treatment provided by Dr. Herod.	2
Dr Herod is quiet, but very efficient.  He listens well which, in my opinion, is very important in a doctor.  I recommend him highly. 	2
Dr. Herrod, and everyone else at the office, were very professional.  On time, through, and appropriate care.  As a health care provider myself, I appreciate Dr. Herrod’s approach to care.  His decision process started with the basics and took what I feel are very appropriate next steps.  I use a military pharmacy and his initial drug choice was not in their formulary.  The pharmacy communicated  that to the cardiology office and Dr. Herrod changed the order to a similiar drug.	2
My first visit with Dr Herod was time well spent.  The entire experience made me feel welcome, well served.  Staff and doctor alike took time, explained and discussed my concerns and issues and then made me part of the decision on options moving forward.  Its what we all hope for in personal healthcare.	2
Love how he listens to me and doesn’t rush. Doesn’t push tests on me that aren’t needed. Love Dr Harrod. 	2
"Dr.Herod is obviously the type of doctor who is really concerned with the wellbeing of his patients. My last visit proved that. 
E Dessel "	2
Dr. Herod is a very professional and caring doctor. When you are with him it is like you are talking to a good friend who knows what he is talking about. He makes you feel at ease like you have known each other for a long time. When he explains things to you he does it so that you understand what is going on and he leaves no question unanswered. I just wish more doctors were like him.	2
Dr. Herod makes an uncertain health risk understandable with great compassion.  The office staff is kind and thorough.  	2
Dr. Herod runs a tight ship... His office staff is very friendly and very efficient... I always get in at the scheduled time of my appointment.... Dr.Herod takes his time to listen to me and is genuinely concerned about my overall health issues....I am very pkeased with his care and his office management.... 	2
I would like to cover my trip to Aurora Cardiologists and specifically Dr. Herod. Let's face, we all are a little worried when it is suggested that we go to a cardiologist.  The office staff was pleasant, helpful and the wait for the Medical staff, was short.  My nurse explained things and did an EKG, professionally, explaining what she would cover. My time with Dr. Herod, was great.  Again, being worried, he was thorough and clear..  He explained all aspects of EKG, and answers all questions. 	2
"Dr Herrod is very professional and patient.. It’s not always easy to clearly articulate my symptoms, but he is able to cut through the fog and address the problem.
His staff is quite confidence inspiring and kind as well. 
As a patient over 81 years young I feel that my long time cardiovascular problems are addressed well."	2
Dr. Herod was amazing.  Listened and that is SO appreciated these days. I didn't feel rushed. Also I understood what procedures I needed and what to expect. 	2
"Outstanding manner. He listens and gives understandable explanations to questions.  Plan of care is provided with patient input. 
Excellent physician with great bedside manner. He cares about his patients. He also presents a very professional image. "	2
"Very nice and compassionate individual.  I have seen him twice and both times he took great care to ensure I understood my condition and what to do.

Office staff deserves kudos also."	2
Dr Friedman is very caring, positive and thorough.  He has a most pleasing bed side manner.  He is a very pleasant Dr.   His office staff is most exemplary.  They are pleasant, helpful and very very courteous.  It is a totally positive experience to go to that office.	2
I have been seeing Dr. Freidman for several years. He is punctual,friendly and takes the time to explain your health in detail.He has helped me maintain good health.I look forward to visiting him every few months. The staff is also extremely nice.	2
Excellent 	2
arrogant, office visits are 2 hours long. poor communicator. 	0
Very professional and courteous.  Takes time to explain and examine.  Did not feel rushed. I have been a patient for over 2 years and highly recommend Dr. Labroo.	2
I am 73 and if I were to write out the qualifications of my ideal doctor, Dr. Labroo would come nearest to meeting them all.  He cares, he listens, and I never feel rushed.  Most important of course, he’s a wonderful cardiologist. 	2
Very easy to talk to and spend adequate time discussing any issue.	2
"Dr. Labroo is an excellent cardiologist. He has a very caring attitude and treats you with respect. He answered all of my questions and took his time. My wait time was good and he has a wonderful staff. 
I recommend him highly."	2
We think highly of Dr Labroo, my husband has been under his excellent care for a long time and I just became a patient. Is very caring and listens to his patients, spends appropriate amount of time.	2
Dr. Labroo is awesome! He is very caring and takes his time explaining things to you, does not rush in and out hard to find with physicians these days.  You don't have to wait long in office and staff are very nice and courteous.   I highly recommend Dr. Labroo. 	2
I would highly recommend Dr Labroo!  His staff is not only friendly but extremely efficient.  Dr. Labroo is extremely thorough, and at the same time very caring and easy to talk with.  	2
Dr. Labroo is the finest Cardiologist you will ever know and the most wonderful and professional person you will ever want to know. Dr. Labroo and his team worked everything involved in the execution of my Heart-Cath with the perfection of a Phil-Harmonic Symphony and I am grateful to him and his staff not just because they gave me a good diagnosis but because they are the finest cardiology medical team I have ever known. Thank you all so very much! See you in 20 years!	2
Dr LaBroo and his assistant were both very professional and friendly and caring! Shonda explained what she was doing and listened to what I had  to say. She is very knowledgeable! Dr LaBroo introduced himself and we discussed my health issues then he explained about my problems and have me a plan to help me. He listened understood what  I had to say!	2
I was having some problems with heart palpitations and my blood pressure going high and low. I was referred to Dr. Labroo and my first visit his PA changed my Medicine that I had been on for many years which helped me. I feel confident in the staff. They treated me very well and it was iif I wasn’t a stranger. They were prompt with my appointment and very little wait time in the office. I also love that they have a web site that Incan access my medical care later.  Very happy. 	2
"He is the Best in our Panama City Fl area
The Care is Great , they spend time with you , the Staff is outstanding, they work at getting a time that works for you
Give them a try and you will see they are the Team to take care of you"	2
I highly recommend Dr LaBroo! He exudes confidence & knowledge. He puts patients at ease while in simple terms explains a course of action.	2
Ease of appointments  and when I arrive I'm greeted with an efficient staff. The wait time is quick. I can't say enough about the skill level of every employee there. Dr Labroo certainly takes care of all my Cardiovascular needs. I would highly recommend him to anyone. He is certainly worth the drive to Panama city. 	2
My husband and myself were not only impressed by his amazing knowledge of the high technology in cardiac surgery, but his personality to make one feel comfortable and at ease.  His Dr. to Patient politeness is not always that we have experienced with some of the Doctors we have seen in the past. Many times my husband would stand up when a Dr. enters the room to say good morning/afternoon and hold out his hand to shake and many Doctors have actually walked right by him.  First impression matters.	2
Dr. Labroo Professional, friendly, knowledgeable.  Great friendly staff.	2
Excellent care. My wait time was short. Dr.Labroo explained evetything to in a way I understood what was going on and the tests he was ordering. 	2
He and His entire staff Truly Care about 'the Patient'. My husband has been treated very well. Dr La Broo listens and does not disregard any issue. Each and every question is answered! His knowledge and skill are beyond comparison! 	2
"Dr. Labroo was recommended to me in Destin, FL where he had previously practiced prior to his current position in Panama City.  I visited Dr. Labroo for a second opinion concerning a heart valve replacement.
He was in total agreement with me in stating yes, i should have the procedure ASAP inasmuch as I was already exhibiting early symptoms which my regular cardiologist seemed to be ignoring.   I would recommend Dr. Labroo highly and it was apparent he is an extremely competent Med practitioner."	2
He is very professional while very friendly, warm and interested in the patient	2
Out of all my Doctors & specialists Dr V is the best and smartest by far.  When none else could figure out my Syndrome Dr V did and has put me on the road to revovery.	2
Sharp young doctor who was very reassuring personally, while also medically astute.  I felt that I was given the best possible care, and I highly recommend Dr. Viswanathan and his practice. Well run office and staff, very efficient.  Most importantly, the doctor is medically skilled. I'm glad that I see Dr. Sundeep Viswanathan!	2
Excellent Dr. listens to all concerns and explains all of your questions you may have. Does not rush takes as much time as needed.	2
I am a new patient and have only seen Dr. Viswanathan 1 time but he was very approachable and knowledgable.	2
He is funny, warm and caring. So smart! We drive an hour to see him.	2
Dr. Viswanathan is always very friendly and direct.  He gives very understandable diagnoses and tells you clearly what is right or wrong with your heart health.  He helped me realize the reason for my occasional fainting spells and thus prevent them. They had been going on for85 years!  Consulting with him is very reassuring for me.   	2
Excellent doctor with great staff and assistants.  Very personable, caring and helpful.  I would recommend you contact him if you are having any health/cardio concerns.  Thorough and understands your needs and concerns and addresses them with you as if you are his only patient.  Would highly recommend you give him a call and you can rest assured he address your worries/concerns in a timely and professional manner.  	2
"I highly recommend Dr. Viswanathan.  He is very thorough, answers all questions, and explains things very well.  
"	2
I have only had one visit but they are very organized and Dr. V. was awesome.  He was very knowledgeable and to the point.  I have to have some tests done and they were able to schedule everything quickly and conveniently all on the same day.  I look forward to being their patient.	2
Dr Viswanathan is a very pleasant young man & a competent doctor of cardiology. I say that with little knowledge of his field, as I don't have heart disease. (I think) I am however, an excellent judge of character & in my opinion he is quite the character.  lol. He keeps his eye on the ball during the exam, seems to be looking/listening inside of you, looking for unusual noises. He insists in the patient participating in the process with feedback that is useful. 	2
Fantastic office and I felt safe with the provider	2
"Dr.Viswanathan  is very professional in his office visit and very good about answering any questions that I might have,
 "	2
I am a patient of Dr. Viswanathan. He is very knowledgeable and explains everything I need to know about my condition. His staff is always courteous and make me feel comfortable at my visits. I trust the Dr.'s decisions about my care and he always listens and answers questions that I may have. I feel that I am in good hands with this Doctor and would recommend Aurora Denver Cardiology as a whole for cardiac care.	2
"I have total faith in Dr V as my Mom's cardiologist.  Also, Dr V. is in line with my feeling about health care... if medication is needed, great, if you don't need it... let's get rid of it.  Dr V. is just as concerned about my Mom's mental state through all this as her physical state.  He speaks to her honestly but with compassion.  He does not try to impress us with big medical words but speaks to us in terms we can grasp. Always ready to answer questions and... he remembers his patients!  
"	2
You can trust your heart with Dr. Rao.  She is a doctor because she wants to help her patients live a heart healthy life.  She treats her patients like they are members of her family.  She does not practice medicine routinely, she treats YOU.  She listens to your needs and goes beyond to solve your problems.  I have been blessed for over 20 years after my open heart surgery in Pennsylvania to have Dr. Srisha Rao care for me and my family.     Edward Hritzo   August 2017	2
All we can say She's awesome!!! The staff very professional, very understanding, and they all care about your needs, best office ever.	2
While Dr Rao does not do surgery, she has a 5 star surgical team that supports her.  She gets difficult things done because she is well respected and well likes by all the people she works with.  She will spend as much time as needed in her office or in the hospital to insure that you are well taken care of.  	2
"As always a very good visit. Very informative and helpful suggestions to 
better my health situation. Always a pleasant visit with Dr. Sosland"	2
Dr. Sosland is amazing!  How she can remember so much about your personal history is  beyond me.  We have come a long way together and I absolutely love her and I know she will be my cardiologist for the rest of my journey.	2
What's great about a heart doctor visit?  Well ...when going to Dr Sosland , she's soooo rocks....so if you are looking for a heart doctor , come see for yourself...Smiles	2
Dr. Sosland is a personable and thorough professional that actually takes the time to hear and consult with her patients.  She has easily earned my trust with her knowledge and expertise.  I drive over four hours to see her and have her oversee my heart care!	2
I have never met a physician who is as kind and caring as Dr. Sosland; she is truly interested in you. She looks you in the eye when talking to you, does not just stare at a computer screen asking questions like so many other doctors I've encountered. I chose Dr. Sosland 2 yrs ago when I needed a Cardiologist--I have never regretted that decision. If you are looking for excellence in a physician, you would be wise to choose Dr. Sosland. 	2
"IT TOOK THEM 4  DAYS OF PROMPTING TO SCHEDULE THE HOLTER MONITOR. WE WENT BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE MY PCP SAID THEY FAXED IT BUT YOUR OFFICE SAID SHE DIDN'T. MY REFERRAL WAS MIS FILED SOMEHOW. IT TOOK BEING SLIGHTLY AGGRESSIVE TO HAVE SOMOEONE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK TO FIND IT. 
BUT THE APPOINTMENT TO GET IT PLACED WAS QUICK AND EFFICIENT. SHE WAS GREAT AT EXPLAINING WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT. RESPONSE FOR RESULTS WAS THE AVERAGE FOR THIS KIND OF TEST. "	1
Dr. Sosland is very thorough and spends time with each of her patients.	1
I highly recommend Dr Sosland to anyone who is looking for a cardiologist who will listen closely and  give excellent treatment. She is a very pleasant and friendly person who gives me great confidence that she is taking care of my health needs.	2
Rushes through visits after you have waited 2+ hours to see her. She gave me a few different diagnoses for the same condition over time and forgot. Don’t recommend. 	0
"Dr Sosland  is caring, very kind and really listens to what you have to say, never rushes you.  I feel she really knows her stuff.


"	2
Cares about patient above all. She is my choice to live my life in the best way possible.  Total trust in her for over 5 years and hopefully a lot longer!	2
I was very disappointed after having a recent CABG and having pains, tried to have someone look at it and the receptionist basically handed me a card and told me to call the nurse line and they’ll get back to you today. Makes me concerned a cardiologist office would treat patients that way....	0
I think she is a wonderful doctor. She has helped me get on the fegjt track for the last 9 tears	2
"She is a very compassionate doctor.  She is very receptive to your thoughts and she is all about ""making your life better"".  I have never had a bad experience with her or her staff.  You never hear a bad word in the halls, exam room or the waiting room about Dr. Sosland."	2
She is my 4th Cardiologist since 1993 and the first to listen when I talk and try to workout any problems I might have. I trust her.  I fired my last cardiologist and glad that I found Dr Sosland. What a difference.  She cares about her patients and she shows it.  I highly recommend her for men or women with heart issues.  Her staff, as well, is very friendly and helpful in every way.	2
I take my 96 year old mother to see Dr. Sosland.  I appreciate the tender care that Dr. Sosland and her staff provide us.  Always through and receives follow up info from moms other doctors to coordinate her care.   New office is great because doors (inside the building) are ADA accessable, not just the outside doors.	2
I have been taking Statins for years to lower my LDL cholesterol.  Though I got moderate success with them, the side effects had become unacceptable.  Dr. Sosland looked at my medical & family history.  When she learned I had been given three different Statins over the years with only moderate success at lowering my LDL, she prescribed a new drug that didn't have those side effects.  After 4 months on that new medication my LDL is lower than it has ever been, well within recommended levels.  	1
From the very first hand shake I knew I was going to like Dr Sosland. Her office is run very efficiently with wait time under ten minutes. She gives you her full attention, explaining condition and answering questions. She quickly makes notes, then hands you a summary of the visit. The efficiency and attention to detail show she respects your time. Since my first visit three years ago I retired and moved but make the 2.5 hour drive to see because I have confidence in her. 	2
Dr. Sosland is very personalable.  She listens well and answers my questions to my satisfaction. I have confidence that she will watch my condition and prescribe what is needed for my good health.   I would be very happy to recommend Dr. Sosland to family and friends.  I didn't think she was accepting new patients.  I think if I needed more time to speak with her, she would give it to me.  I have not yet had to schedule an urgent appointment.	2
Just love the friendliness of everyone no wait time makes me feel at ease, Dr Sosland is the best!	2
Dr. Sosland, her nursing staff and tech's are superb.  They are caring, professional, sensitive, and expert concerning my family's and my patient care over many years.  In short, she and her staff are top-notch, and I recommend Dr. Sosland utmost for cardiology care.  I feel fortunate to have her as our physician.	2
She’s always very thorough and asks all the right questions. She gives me the opportunity to have input on my care and medications. 	2
Her desire to control or eliminate  drugs was comforting.  I felt that I had true support to control my problem.	2
My primary care physician recommended Dr. Sosland specifically.  At my first appointment I could tell why.  She is extremely knowledgeable, patient, personable, and willing to listen to and answer questions.  She displays genuine care and concern for patient health.  The staff, too, is friendly and efficient.  As much as one can when visiting the doctor, I've enjoyed my visits.  And while I hope to not be a frequent visitor, I wouldn't go anywhere else. 	2
I have always found Dr. Sosland to be very professional and understanding. She takes the time to explain my health problems and what needs to be done. If I call with a question someone gets back to me very quickly. I would highly recommend her and the office of Midwest Heart and Vascular Specialist.	2
waited 2 hours.  why: had no choice,  Then after 7 months NO Answers.......	0
It was a good office visit, everyone was caring and friendly	2
she explains  everything. she doesn't keep me waiting and has a good staff.	2
Knowledgeable, explains procedures well and an excellent listener. 	2
It is rare to find a doctor with such amazing people skills and knowledge. From the moment she walked in to the exam room, she instilled confidence in me while I was there on behalf of my 80 year old mother. She was the perfect combination of knowledgeable, confident and compassionate. Willing to answer questions and never made us feel rushed or unimportant. I feel she was spot on with her assessment and I hope I never do need her services, but If I do, I know I am in good care. 	2
Dr explained the procedure he was going to do for my father. In detail. Putting us at ease. Very grateful he took the time to explain.	2
Dr Sabates us a great physician with optimal bedside manners and humanity. I fully recommend him without hesitation. I appreciate him and his staff	2
Dr. Sabates is a horrible person. My dad passed away, and even though Dr. Sabates has been his cardiologist for years, he refuses to sign his death certificate, even though he has been acting as my dad's primary care physician as well. My family has been going to that office for decades, and I cannot believe the disrespect we are getting.	0
Absolutely the best !! 	2
Excellent doctor! Very caring, honest, treats you like family. You cannot find a better doctor to take care of your medical needs. His staff is amazing, thank you so much for everything!  	2
Cardiovascular Disease claimed the life of three of my brothers. When I felt my turn is coming, I Went  on a mission to save my life until I landed in Dr Ed Sabates office. First visit became Everladting Visits.He explained his Ed.Background, his long years in Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology. Then said “do u feel I can help you? Listening to me, he explained,detailed,clarified,summarized a plan and asked to forge “Team Relation”between us inmy Treatment Journey. He is my Savior&Brother!	2
Amazing office, staff, very caring doctor. They make you feel at home 	2
in medico muy Bueno	2
Dr. Sabates is caring, friendly, great bedside manner, keeps you informed and seems genuinely interested in you as a person. I would recommend him highly. 	2

THANK YOU
GLADYS NORRIS"	2
Dr. Sabetes, saved my life. I will be forever greatful. He is a gentle soul and a wonderful doctor.	2
"Recent visit was excellent with Dr Denyer. He reviewed my options using current meds to maintain lower blood pressure and scheduled a pacemaker evaluation
later this month."	2
Friendly efficient staff, easy scheduling and excellent care	2
I have been a patient of Austin Heart and Dr. Denyer for the past 5 years.  I find him to be extremely helpful and supportive.  He is frank and cautious, he gives you the insight you need to make the right decisions.  I always leave feeling as if my expectation has been exceeded.	2
Got in within two hours of calling to set an appointment.  I sat less than 3 minutes in the waiting area.  This was the best doctor visit I’ve ever experienced!	2
Always very personable and he us very much into prevention of issues if possible. I have been going to him for 10 years and highly recommend him as a cardiologist.	2
My favorite Doctor,   Great person	2
Dr. Denyer has been my heart doctor for the past 10 years. My primary care physician, Daniel Voss, MD, recommended that I see Dr. Denyer for my heart care. I continue to see Dr. Denyer and recommend him to my friends and family.	2
Dr Denyer was friendly, helpful, caring and professional. We felt immediately that we had found the right doctor. He takes time to know your health issues and gives recommendations on how to make your life better. We highly recommend him.	2
"I have been a patien of Dr. Robert  Denyer, Austin Heart, Georgetown, for several years.   I have had nothing but good experiences.   Everyone is very friendly and helpful, from the front office staff to the nurses and Dr Denyer himself and the check out/scheduling staff.

I would definitely recommend his practice to family and friends."	2
Good	2
He was very open and considerate and explained everything to me so I could understand the issues and answers.	2
I had my first appointment with Dr. Denyer March 25, 2019. He took the time to communicate with me, as well as perform an extensive physical. My goal is to find a Cardiologist who is a people person and will help me make decisions about me care that match my preferences and goals. I believe I have found such a doctor and look forward to future visits.	1
De Denyer was easy to talk to answered all my questions. I’m sure I’m in good hands	2
Caring and competent.  Very thorough and attentive.	2
I've been seeing Dr. Denyer for almost 10 years. Very thorough.	1
Very professional staff and cardiologist. Recently moved to this area from Houston and am very satisfied with Dr. Denyer's advise and group.	2
"Dr. Denyer cares about his patients and takes the ""time"" to listen to your needs.  He will never make you feel like your taking up his time and can not wait to get to his next patient.  His compassion and awesome manners just shows that he earned his degree to ""help"" people not for the $$$.  Thank you Dr. Denyer for love and dedication you give your practice."	2
First impressions mean a lot to me so I was very pleased to have such a positive impression of Dr. Denver and his entire staff. I have just moved here and that experience can be very stressful but Dr. Denver and the staff put me right at ease and they spent enough time with me to make me confident that I will receive the best care possible in the future.	2
"Dr. Denyer has unique qualifications.
He possesses excellent prognosis and intervention skills
and at the same time
he possesses excellent common sense.
I could not be more pleased with his attention to my condition."	2
Quick study who dove into my medical history, asked penetrating questions, and made clear and concise recommendations for immediate actions to advance treatment. Personable, professional, action-oriented.	2
He listened  to me. Thanks for your  care 	2
Service was great - Dr. Denyer took the time to review my history and discuss future care.	2
DR. DENYER HAS A UNIQUE WAY TO CONNECT WITH HIS PATIENTS-HE ACTUALLY LISTENS TO ONES CONCERNS, ASKS PERTINENT QUESTIONS-AND AGAIN, ACTUALLY LISTENS TO ONES RESPONSE. HE KNEW MY MEDICAL HISTORY FROM FRONT TO BACK. I AM, INDEED, FORTUNATE TO HAVE HIM AS ONE OF MY PHYSICIANS. KIND OF UNIQUE WHEN ONE HAS MEDICARE.	2
Excellent cardiologist and doctor. Caring, precise and has a sense of humor. He inspires confidence and trust. I feel lucky to have been referred to him.	2
"Feel very comfortable with Dr Denyer he listens and has a genuine concern for you wellbeing . He takes the time to give a thorough exam and has excellent followup.
"	2
I have complete faith in Dr. Denyer to handle my heart needs. he takes time to explain my concerns. He is professional and friendly. He provides the treatment needed on my behalf. I would recommend Dr. Denyer to my friends and relatives.	2
This was my first visit, but it was very painless.   Dr Denyer was very through in checking on my heart issues.  Since he had no prior records, tests were scheduled quickly, and appointments were made for another visit after the test and records arrive.  Dr Denyer made me feel comfortable and was very concern with my issues.  Glad I found him.	2
Dr. Denyer has been our family cardiologist for several years. I have full trust that he has our best interest at heart. He works with you to understand what your health issues are and what they might become. He helps with finding the right meds with  better pricing for me. The staff and Dr. are all friendly, organized and professional. They make me feel special and a person, not a number.	2
Dr Denyer solved a mystery that had eluded 3 other cardiologists.   I had a stroke, but no one could figure out why.  Dr Center ran the usual tests, nothing.  Just as he was about to give up he gave one last try, and pulled out his stethoscope at the right moment.  AFIB!  Thank you doc, you didn't quit till you had the answer.   I've since then had an ablation, no more AFIB.  I got my life back!	2
Excellent doctor recommend to everyone	2
Dr. Denyer is an extremely good doctor with an amazing staff.  He is very compassionate, very patient and has a great sense of humor.  He and his staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and confident.	2
Have been with Dr Denver for several years and always be happy with the service I have received..	2
Am delighted to have found Dr, Denyer. Feel like my heart condition is in excellent hands. High marks in every category. 	2
I  had open heart surgery a few years ago and am so comfortable  to now be followed by Dr Denyer.  My very first visit he took the time to go over the records I had brought with me from elsewhere.  I did not feel rushed, felt comfortable  to ask questions, and am confident that I have found an excellent heart dr that I  can trust,  not only for routine follow-up, but  also if an emergency problem should occur. 	2
WE MOVED FROM THE HOUSTON AREA AND WERE LOOKING FOR A GOOD CARDIOLOGIST IN THIS AREA AND DR. DENYER WAS RECOMMENDED BY OUR CARDIOLOGIST. WE ARE VERY SATISFIDED WITH OUR VISIT AND WILL SEE HIM ON A REGULAR BASIS.  HE IS VERY EASY TO TALK TO AND HAS A GREAT SINCE OF HUMOR. WILL RECOMMEND HIM TO OTHERS.	2
Dr. Denyer is always is very caring and  professional in my appointments with him.  Have been seeing him for 8 years and is very good about explaining any changes in the diagnosis of my condition.  Have complete trust that I am in good care when I see him.	2
Dr. Denyer and his staff are a great group of people. He has been my cardiologist for almost 5 years. I trust him and his staff. I am glad we found him.	2
"He is the ""BEST""....knows his medical stuff and he cares for you the patient.  I feel blessed in finding a doctor who will be contacted to my well being.  Dr. Denyer is a very good doctor and he cares very deeply about his patients."	2
Experience with Dr. Denyer was excellent.  However, the experience with the technician that supplied me with the Holter Monitor was rushed with limited explanation on what it was for or how it was to be used.  I went home and looked it up the information on line.  Not sure what her problem was, but we felt we were intruding on her time, and felt very rushed.  We were told we did not have an appointment, but we had it in writing, so they worked us in.  Maybe that was her problem.	0
Dr. Denyer was very professional, compassionate, knowledgeable. I appreciated his willingness to talk about any question I had and the fact that he gave reasons/explanations for his recommendations. He is a person who passionately wants to help us get better and looks at all the possibilities and how they might fit into our lives/abilities. I am not, by nature, a trusting person, but Dr. Denyer has earned my confidence.	2
 Dr. D. is a GREAT Doc!!!	2
I had my first appointment with Dr. Robert Denyer and it was a pleasant experience.  I will be turning 65 soon and felt I needed to see a cardiologist since I have always been told I have a heart murmur.  I was impressed with all the staff from the people at the front desk, the nurse, and the checkout staff.  	2
"Dr Denyer is great!
I would definately recommend him to other people."	2
I experienced a professional atmosphere from my arrival to departure.  Dr. Denyer was very thorough and answered all of my questions.  It is this kind of positive experience that encourages me to recommend his practice to my relatives and friends.  	2
Although I've seen Dr. Denyer several times, my appointment was with Steven this time.  Steven took time to explain the result of my CT in great detail.   I would totally recommend both Dr. Denyer and Steven.	2
A few years ago, I had a very serious episode of A-fib.  The E.R. doctor told my family and me that I would probably not survive as he had been unable to get my heart into sinus rhythm.  I was there for hours before Dr. Denyer, who was on call, was contacted.  Once Dr. Denyer took over, my heart responded and I was released the next morning. He has been my cardiologist ever since as, had it not been for him, I would not be here to write this review.	2
grfeat Doc and top[ on everything going on with the Heart.	2
Excellent Doctor, nurse (Carmen) was very caring and attentive and courteous office staff 	2
Great!	2
Dr. Cerami is amazing! Never seen a cardiologist that shows how much he truly cares for his patients. The office staff are just as amazing, everyone is extremely friendly and helpful! You could honestly tell everyone there is passionate about their jobs! Wouldn’t change this Cardiologist for anything, highly recommended!  	2
Dr. Cerami has been so helpful in getting the care and follow up I have needed.   He shows genuine concern and I have never felt rushed when seen by him.	2
Very concerned with my overall health yet listened to my suggestions or questions with open mind.	1
Dr. Cerami is very caring.  I wasn't feeling well that day swollen feet and high blood pressure.  I called the office and one of the receptionists said he was booked that day and could see me the following week.  I insisted and told her to tell him of my problem and he saw me that afternoon and I did have a blood pressure problem.	2
Excellent	2
His knowledge and determination in understanding and addressing my heart health concerns were comforting and reassuring. I really felt that he was listening to me. Much appreciated!	2
I was told I need to get evaluated by a cardiologist due to a abnormal EKG me being 40 it was truly nerve wrecking. I have to say from the moment I walked in the staff was very nice. Next day I had to come in for an echo and the tech (Raul)was amazing. What a nice and professional person.  The office manager as well was there and she was super attentive, informative and helpful. I am a Director of Operations for health centers and closely watch things like this. Keep up the great work! 	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Cerami for well over 5 years and trust his judgement.  He takes his time to explain various options available instead of prescribing medications-something quite rare these days.	2
The office staff was friendly but obviously annoyed that I had an appt through health grades and not aware of my appt.  Despite that they were accommodating to me.  The medical staff listen and make you feel comfortable.  Dr. Cerami took the time to listen, converse and devise a plan without making you feel like a number.  	2
"What I like about Dr Cerami is he really listens to what you are saying, ask questions and will review your chart to come up with a plan or solution to try.  When I leave his office I feel good about the visit even if I've received ""not so good of news""."	2
Excellent doctor and staff. Pleasant and knowledgeable 	2
When discussing my medical problems, Dr. Cerami has always explained things in an understanding manner.	1
Dr. Cerami was recommended by my primary physician. I was very pleased with how smoothly and efficiently the office visit went. 	2
The staff are very professional as well as Dr Cerami.  He takes hi time with you and is very thorough. Highly recommend!	2
Such a wonderful  Doctor,  and the staff  is Awsome 	2
I like Dr. Cerami because he is genuinely interested in my health. He has a pleasant bedside manner . 	2
Love Dr. Cerami	2
We have known Dr. Cerami for several years and have always known him to be caring, competent and professional at all times.  Would recommend him highly.	2
Great doctor, great staff, very organized office staff	2
Dr Cerami is very professional and prepared. He answered all my questions and explained with details my condition. However, the frontdesk girl at the pembroke office is not very corteous neither compassionate. If she needs to call you, make sure you answer within the first second before she hang up on you. If you call back , she will not answer. Do not expect a second call from her or a voice message. If you show up in person you will see that she is not busy but she is not willing to help you. 	0
I was concerned the first time I visited Dr. Le but he was so through and nice that I got over it quickly. Now after my second visit (with tests) I feel that I chose the best doctor for me. He explained options and was very helpful. No one wants to hear that they need to drop 30 pounds but he explained how I should go about it. He also told me I needed to cut back on carbs. I really liked the way he explained the test results and what needed to be done to keep my heart healthy. I've got a follow up appointment in 6 months to see if I've made any progress (I get the picture 5 lb per month) and improvements in heart functions.	2
I traveled to the office at inlet beach which was very up to date with latest equipment and very clean. I was seen quickly, staff were professional and personable. Although the drive was 45 min for me I would go again. They scheduled a procedure for me the following week and took care of all the details. Overall excellent experience.	2
Outstanding surgeon, and considerate doctor who treated me with true care.	2
very good doctor highly recomend 	2
Dr. Le is the only cardiologist I will ever see, much less recommend. He is professional, compassionate and takes the time to listen and accurately diagnose. He performed my 88 year old mother’s and my heart catheter procedure. I have seen many doctors, none like Dr. Le.  Steve M	2
I have known Dr. Le for a number years. I have A-FIB, which he diagnosed a  number of years ago as well. Last week, after a thorough examination, EKG and heart scan, he said you need a pacer maker now!! He made all the arrangements and said report to Gulf Coast Cardio, Outpatient Surgery tomorrow at 4 pm. That was Thursday a week ago. You would know it to look at me, except for the grin and smile on my face and a  perfect heart rate of 60 bpm. Thank you Dr. Le.We Love ya!  Dr. Charles H. Ebbecke	2
Doctor Le is straightforward with his patients and is concerned with their welfare.  I would recommend him to anyone.	2
Dr. Le took a lot of time listening to my concerns, I did no feel rushed at all. Thank you!	2
Great doctor, he responds to heart problems you are having immediately.	2
Dr Le listens intently and advises beyond the immediate problem. I had been suffering with acute breathlessness for some time. He never appears rushed.  Dr Le in my first appointment made a change to my medication and the breathlessness became much more manageable. The fact that he now has a second centre which is much nearer than the main hospital is an added benefit.	2
My wife had a heart attack and dr Le was her doctor. I would highly recommend him. He was so knowledgeable and took time to teach me what was going on. He really cares. He was called in at 530 in morning when he had just left hospital. His parents are his top priority. We were on vacation and 8 hours away when she had a heart attack. He had to install a balloon in her heart. He explained what the purpose was and showed me how it worked. Awesome awesome doctor. I thank god he was here.	2
Dr. Le was on call the night my husband came in to the emergency room.  We are fairly new to the area and did not have a cardiologist.  Dr Le did two different procedures on my husband, and most likely saved his life.  I would highly recommend Dr. Le—he is very kind and explained EVERYTHING to us so we could understand the treatment plan.  	2
"I am a very happy patient. 
I am a good example of your professional competence.  You are the best I know in our area and
particularly grateful that you are in the chain of competent and responsive
doctors of which you are my most important link.  
In 2015 you implanted a pacing defibrillator and in 2016 you
suspected a hole between the root of my aortic valve and my right ventricle
that was causing an increasingly terrible shortness-of-breath problem.  Because you are curious, a good listener, "	2
Doctor Le has made a change in my life he bedside manor is top notch always a pleasure to see him and he makes you feel like your his only paticent and give helpful advise and complete care	2
He saved my husbands life by putting a defibrillator vest on him when he left the hospital. It saved his life twice. He was very good to diagnose and treat him and I would recommend him to anyone with heart disease.	2
Dr Le has provided outstanding medical advice and surgical skills to me over a period of about 5 years----2 cath procedures with stents, a pacemaker installation---all with outstanding results.  Top notch communicator who takes the time to hear and address your concerns. particularly with life threatening issues.  I highly recommend Dr Le and guarantee you will not be disappointed in his ability to determine a proper procedure and advice on long range health issues concerning you and your family	2
Dr. Le is the best and his staff is SECOND TO NONE.. Dr Le will give you the answer to all your question. He is a real careing Doctor who put his patients first. From the time you walk in his office you are greeted with a hello and smile.  His receptionist is top notch and if I still had my company I would try to hire her away from Dr. Le.	2
I have recommend both friends and family to Dr. Le.  Dr. Le genuinely cares about his patients.  He has outstanding abilities and training.  I would not trust my health to anyone else in this area.	2
Dr. Le is great. He listens to me. Has time for me. He explains everything so I can understand it. I really like him as a doctor a person.	2
Dr Le has a great bed side manner. He always answers my questions and has time for me! I like that he doesn’t rush and remembers who I am!	2
My dad had a severe heart attack a little over a year ago.  Dr Le cared for him when he went into the hospital and continued to care for him on his follow up appointments.  My dad made a complete recovery at 77 years old thanks to his initially quick and continued care.  He is kind and talks to his patients like they are family.  He is amazing!	2
I have seen Doctor Le Twice thus far. He is a most amazing physician and I cannot imagine you will find anyone better. He is professional and knowledgeable beyond belief in my opinion he walks on water and parts the red sea! He has a great bedside manner to the point where you don't want to leave, He's quite concerned and listens and seems to leave no stone unturned. I highly recommend him and my wife, who's an RN with 40+ years experience can't wait to meet him because of his care for me! 	2
Staff has been great.  was able to get appointments without waiting weeks or months.  Only visited for minor issues but happy with services so far.  Drove from Destin to Panama as Dr has great Referral from my P.C. Dr.  Destin office opens in July...	2
Dr. Le is a great doctor. I feel confident in his assessment of my issues. 	2
Dr. Le  is very professional.  He will explain to you what is going on and take the time to answer your questions.  	2
Dr. Le was exceptional in his evaluation of the medical records I brought and his examination of me personally and I was very pleased with my care and my follow up so far.	2
I first met Dr. Le in Miramar Beach location about 2 to 3 years ago where he did some testing for me. All business at first (probably evaluating me and my personality). My overall impression and experience was outstanding. That is why I made another appointment with him specifically for his advice and guidance for the 2nd time today 11/04/2016..  Dr. Le is top notch.	2
He really listens his patients . He is very kind and understanding. Has great bedside manners.	2
My first experience with Dr Le dos not give me a very favorable impression.  I expected my body to respond better than it did.  After seeing Dr Le again, I can tell you that he is aggressively pursuing my case and I am very happy with my care at this point.  I would recommend Dr Le for any cardiology care.	2
Dr. Funk and his staff are extremely kind and considerate and made me feel very comfortable in an uncomfortable situation. They were able to diagnose issues I had been struggling with for decades with other doctors, in no time at all. They gave me hope and changed my life! Thank you so much! No better staff out there!	2
Dr. Funk is so kind and patient. I have been seeing him for about 6 yrs or more. He always has a smile on his face. His concern for his patients is remarkable. I would recommend him a million times over. The office is just as lovely as he is.	2
Dr. Funk is truly one of the best doctors we have gone to.  I would recommended him all day every day. He is kind and truly a good human being. He takes such care and concern for his patients and makes them feel like family.  He was instrumental in my husband having a  procedure that no other Dr. felt was needed or wanted to perform.  Dr. Funk did not give up and he knew that an Aortic valve replacement was necessary, and he forged ahead until he could find and  send us to the right surgeon.  The surgery has made the world of difference for my husbands quality of life and he feels like a new person. If it was not for Dr. Michael Funk believing in my husbands condition I do not know what the outcome today would be. He is truly the best and we Thank You from the bottom of our heart.  I could not miss telling you about his assistant Natasha she truly is a very caring professional and I do not know what we would do without seeing her also. We love you Natasha!	2
"Office staff was great, Dr Funk is amazing 
Thank you for all you do!"	2
Dr Funk was very nice to my son	2
"Took my son for a check up and was very impressed with the level of attention we received.  

Would definitely recommend Dr Funk to anyone looking for a caring doctor!  He is a primary care physician as well."	2
"I want to express my sincere appreciation for the promptness and professional care given to my son. Our experience was best we have ever encountered. The staff really works like a team!! 
Dr. Funk and his staff are all we could have hoped for in a medical practitioner.  Thank you for your wonderful care. (Beautiful office and great coffee machine!)"	2
The best, simply the best!	2
I am a new patient and had the best experience that I could ask for with Dr.Funk. The first time I went my blood pressure was elevated due to me getting lost. He asked me to monitor it for a couple of days and he took my pressure again. It was borderline. He wanted to put me on a low dosage blood pressure pill but, I asked him if he would allow me to try to get it under control first and if I am not able to then, by all means, I will take the medicine. I was so grateful that he trusted me enough to take control of my health. I hope I don't disappoint him.	1
The absolute best. The medical staff are so knowledgeable. I stopped seeing my podiatrist, and endocrinologist because they were useless. I’ve been a diabetic for the past 23 years and Dr. Funk and Natasha, NPRN has completely improved my health. I am so grateful I found this office.	2
Seems to over test.	1
My wife and myself feel lucky we have him like our Dr. not only a high professional and excellent Dr but a human being person who deeply care for all his patients.We just love him.	2
"I have been a patient of Dr. Funk for 4 years, because of my cardiac abnormal rhythm.  I am really pleased with his professionalism and  kindness,  he shows real care for the overall health of his patients.  Also, he is   very diligent checking the details about his cases and  providing results  of required tests.

His staff is very friendly and proactive. I really like how Natasha provides  the clear and right recommendations about the use of vitamins  and/or  food when reading a patient blood results

I would recommend Dr funk and his staff, especially in his newest location, which is nice :)"	2
Dr. Funk gave me a pre operation exam which included a stress test. He explained things in language I could understand. He even found a skin problem I had which my primary care Doctor had not noticed.  Dr. Funk and his office staff were excellent.	2
My first visit to Dr. Funk was great. The staff was excellent and friendly. Dr. Funk is an  incredible doctor. I am so happy I found him	2
My first appointment will be my last at this office.  Doctor seemed good, but, office staff is horrible.  From the first phone call to make the appointment, to the office visit itself and then the lack of follow thru.  Seems like too many office members, everyone seems to pass the buck and no one takes responsibility.	0
Dr. Funk makes you feel like you and your questions are important. He takes the time to listen and explain. The staff is extremely caring and friendly.	2
"Very compassionate, calls quickly with results.
Office staff is courteous and friendly.  Great office atmosphere, feels like family"	2

Dr . Funk is a great cardiologist. He is very caring ! Always willing to take the time to explain the results and to make sure you have no questions about treatment. His office staff is top notch !

"I've been a patient with Dr. Funk for a few years and I'm very satisfied with his treatment of me and my medical conditions. He is a knowledgeable and compassionate doctor . He explains your treatments and conditions fully and in
understandable language. He answers all your questions and spends the time with you so you never feel rushed. He makes you feel that you are his most important concern .

Hes amazing, truly outstanding. Always wants what's best for patients and family. Super accommodating, gives u the time u need, returns calls promptly. A great dr and person. Wouldnt see anyone else	2
Dr. Funk is the most patient, kind, concerned doctor I’ve ever seen. He even let me ask a question about my son. After he is done assessing you, he stops and asks you if you have any other questions. I completely trust him and his office staff with all of my cardiac needs!	2
He truly cared about my concerns!  He listened and made sure I understood the answers to my questions.  I never felt rushed or unimportant!  I had several in office tests and and each tech was wonderful.  The office staff is polite and I was always called in within minutes of my arrival.	2
Orders too many expensive tests.	0
Dr. Funk and his staff are amazing.  Dr. Funk is one of the most caring and knowledgeable Doctors I have seen in long time.   From day one I always felt, he was giving me his time and never rushing me out of the office, to move on to the next patient.  His staff is caring, warm and professional and I know I am in good hands.  I highly recommend Dr. Funk and have to many people and will continue to do so.  Thank you Dr. Funk for your caring spirit and your unconditional commitment to excellence.  	2
Doctor Funk is one of the most caring Doctors I've have had the pleasure of using . From day one i always felt,  he was giving me his time and never rushing me out of the office, to move on to the next patient. In today's world that is very hard to find. Doctor Funk is also very clear on explaining what your problem is and taking that extra time to make sure you understand. He also answers any r questions you may have.  I have and will continue to recommend him to all of my friends. I would also	2
My wife and I were completely shock by Dr Funk. He is a super doctor, compassionate, caring and shows genuine concern toward my condition.From our past experience with others, we thought this kind of doctor didn't exist in this day and age.We were so wrong and so glad we found Dr Funk.(5) stars does not cover the relief I felt.Thank you so much and his staff was wonderful under all levels.	2
"This was my first visit and I must say my experience was wonderful.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Dr.  Funk took his time and was honest and reassuring.  I am very picky about doctors and do not like the ""conveyor belt"" mentality and this dr and staff is the opposite of that. "	2
Dr. Funk and his staff is amazing!!! Dr. Funk is a caring person. He really takes care of me. The office is amazingly beautiful. The staff is warming and caring. Thanking them for taking care of me for so many years.	2
With doctor Funk , I am in safe hands . Excellent experience, I recommend him .	2
When I saw Dr. Funk I was in extreme pain from hip that has a deteriorated joint. He was so kind in understanding that being cleared for surgery was of upmost importance to me. He patiently explained to me that a further test was necessary to make sure the surgery was safe. Both his expertise and compassionate manner were outstanding.	2
One of the best doctor experiences I've ever had. 	2
I have been seeing him ten years he is so loving and thoroughly interested in your health and well being.  I have never felt rushed Everyone in the office is polite and professional.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Funk’s for 3 years and could not be happier with him and his staff! He is that rare combination of a dedicated, professional physician who is also kind and caring. He takes the time to answer any questions very thoroughly.  And you can see immediately when you are with his staff, that it is a very warm, friendly and family-like atmosphere.  The wait times are minimal, sometimes even early.  Would highly recommend Dr. Funk on all levels.  	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Funk.  He is very caring and professional.  He is also very thorough with all the required testing.  The office staff are all so friendly and always call back.  He is the only Dr. that I have ever been to that you never have to wait.	2
Dr. Michael Funk is one of the most honest, trustworthy professionals I worked with for my health care needs. There was never a time he did not take the time out to sit down and explain to me what was going on with my health and offer his professional advise. I have been seeing Dr. Funk for over ten years now and I could not have made a better choice to leave my heart up to his professional expertise. Thank you Dr. Funk for your caring spirit and your unconditional commitment to excellence. 	2
Where do I start? I am a new patient of Dr. Funk.  The office staff is amazing!!  Everyone is so friendly and efficient.  When you have an appointment, you never wait to be seen.

He allows for any questions and takes the time as well.	2
Dr Funk and his staff have been welcoming, caring, professional, and caring to me as a new-to-the-area patient. I've never felt rushed or unimportant; instead, valued, listened to, and given the opportunity to have input into my course of treatment. I highly recommend Dr Funk, his practice and staff.	2
Great experience.  Excellent (happy) staff.  All caring, considerate, professional and on time appointments in a well run office.  Dr. Funk is all that a patient could ask for.  	2
My wife visited Dr. Michael Funk for the first time last week and I had to be with her. I was concern about the time because I needed to return to work and as a new patient I was expecting processing time etc.  I was surprised how on time everything moved.  We were out of there within 1 one hour.  Dr. Funk was very kind and dedicated his time to understand my wife condition.  I strongly recommend Dr. Funk to any new patient looking for a cardiologist. 	2
Awesome doctor. Staff is so friendly and you aren't waiting hours to see the doctor. 	2
We will be having him as our new primary as well i have already gave information to a friend that needs a cardio dr and will be having my daughter and son in law move as well if they take their insurance. 	1
Great!	2
Wonderful experience .at the office with the doctor and cordial staff 	2
Dr. Funk is a very caring person.  He listens to the patient and explains what the tests are for.  I recommend him to any one who needs a cardiologist.  He is very knowledgeable and has a very pleasant staff.	2
I was lucky enough to be referred to Dr. Funk by a close friend who happens to be an RN I thank my lucky stars!!!! this is the most caring Doctor in the world!!! he patiently listens to your concerns and carefully explains your diagnosis and answers any questions you may have thoughtfully slowly and makes sure you have a full understanding of your condition. If I could give Dr Funk a higher recommendation than excellent I would happily do so!! his office staff are so sweet and helpful!! Great DR	2
"Dr. Funk is the most caring DR. i have ever been to. He always has time to talk to you and answer your questions. He always returns telephone calls in a timely manor. You could not ask for better
"	2
As a first time patient, Dr. Funk made me feel very comfortable and took his time in explaining my treatment. His office staff are very kind and pleasant.  I am looking forward to my next visit.	2
Sound approach to my dilemma with good results.  Affable. Clearly explained his intention for present and future actions in a manner that was clearly understandable.	2
Dr Nielsen was focused on me as a patient. He listened to my concerns and answered my questions. He also went through test results thoroughly. I felt that I was his only patient that day. Grateful I found him.	2
I have been treated at the heart center for fourteen years have been seen by Dr Nielson for the past year very professional as well as his staff	2
We have been patients of Dr. Neilson for several years and he and the entire staff are tremendous and act as a pleasant, well oiled machine.  Every visit is extremely comfortable because of his relaxing demeanor.	2
GREAT DOCTOR!	2
He is very nice.	2
My appointment  with Dr. Nielson was the first since Dr. Sally Sharp my previous cardiologist  for over 12 years retired. He is as good as she was which we appreciate. He took time to get my history and  listen to my problems.	2
Super	2
Professional and Personable	2
"I made an appointment to Dr. Nielson for a 2nd opinion about the condition of my
heart.  I felt like I was in the dark about what was happening from the Dr. I had been seeing.  
What an amazing difference I found at his office from what I had experienced.  The waiting room was clean and neat and very comfortable.  I didn't feel like I was going to catch some dread disease from sitting there.  The receptionist was very courteous and friendly and dressed nicely.  
When I was taken into the area where you weighed and such, the nurse who helped me was upbeat, friendly, and interested in me.
After a short wait, Dr. Nielson came into the examining room and once again I was impressed by his cheerful, upbeat demeanor.  He had already reviewed my information and was prepared to discuss my heart condition with me and answer all my questions.
I now understood what was happening, what to expect, and what needed to be done.  I felt like I could trust my heart health to him."	2
Dr Nielson listened and asked lots of questions and was very pleasant to speak with. 	2
Dr. Nielsen is a terrific doctor and he always takes the time to explain things to you.	2
"Dr. Nielson has been my Doctor for several years.  I see him at least twice a year
and he advises me on getting stress tests and always checks my medication.
I would be happy to anyone needing a good cardiologist."	2
Dr. Neilson was prompt, friendly, professional, and very helpful in helping me with my medical needs as well as answering all the questions I had for him.	2
Dr. Nielson is a superb physician.  Always willing to listen to and respect the patient. Extremely professional, well-informed, with an excellent staff.  Medical emergencies do not always allow the luxury of choosing one’s physician.  I am very fortunate to be in his care.  Absolutely recommend him and his clinic.	2
Outstanding physician. Very thorough. Very concerned. Willing to take time explaining the complex to the uninformed quizzical patient. 	2
Dr. Nielson makes you feel like you are a true partner in your own healthcare.  He takes the time to listen carefully as well as review your medical history.  He explains the benefits and risks of suggested treatment so you can make an informed decision on a course of action.  He shows respect for the patient's ability to understand and participate in finding the best course of action.	2
Appreciated my visits with Dr. Nielson, felt that his knowledge of my heart issues was understood and prognosis was consistent with my expectations. I look forward to a continued relationship.	2
Amazing Doctor and staff! ?? Really worked with me to get my problem with my medication solved. This clinic really cares about it’s patients. 	2
Dr Nielson does a great job of explaining your health issues, and the things you can do to improve those issues. Answers all questions you have.	2
Dr. Nielson has been there for both of us during some potentially fatal heart problems and has successfully guided us both through them.  We both have been able to live happily because of the care he has given us.	2
Dr. Nielsen is very through and considerate.  He takes the time to listen and explain issues. His reputation is stellar.	2
Dr. Nielsen is an excellent Dr. From the first visit he makes you feel at ease and the questions he asks lets you know your health and welfare is of utmost importance. His concerns and expertise lets you know of his concerns for your health. He only orders tests that he knows will provide the needed information that is in the patients best interest. He is also interested in making your spouse and other family members a part of your treatments.	2
Very thorough and caring.	2
I love visiting Dr. Nielson.  His manner and knowledge give me complete confidence in the care I receive.  His medical assistants and nurses are also the best!  Highly recommended!	2
"I've been a Patient of Dr. Nielson since 2004.  I am very pleased with Dr Nielson and his Staff.  I've moved 150 miles from this Medical Facility, but I have full confidence in Dr. Nielson, and changing Cardiologists is not an option with me.         Signed: Nola Mikich 
"	2
Dr. Nielson has been great to work with.  He is very patient, kind and understanding.  He listens attentively and you always feel that he takes the time to understand and discuss your issues and concerns.	2
Dr. Nielson is wonderful. He really listened to my concerns and thoroughly explained and answered any questions I had. One of the best physicians I’ve ever encountered. He is also very knowledgeable and really cares about his patients.	2
He and his staff took the time to listen to and understand my situation.  Everyone was very nice and attentive.  He then prescribed the correct course of action.	2
I am a new patient for Dr. Nielson and one thing that I really appreciated about Dr. Nielson was his willingness to listen as I recounted my history and experiences and concerns regarding my health and heart.  I left my first appointment feeling that I was in the right hands for the important care of my heart.	2
Took time to explain test results and the reasons. Makes you feel at ease about your condition.	1
Dr. Nielson is very personable, very accessible, and is always attentive to my questions and concerns. He keeps me up to date on recommendations for heart disease management. I have known Dr. Nielson for 17 years, since I first experienced symptoms of heart disease, and intervention was necessary. I have full confidence that he is doing exactly what needs to be done to effectively monitor my condition and maintain heart-health. I have highly recommended him to others, including my wife.	2
Dr. Nielson is an excellent doctor. He is always professional and open. I would have no one else deal with my ticker	2
"Dr Nielson is very informative and has a great bedside manner.   He seems to care about his patients.  I wish he would leave more information on his papers he gives to the patients.  By the time I get home I have forgotten everything.  Or if he even made notes on ""My Chart"".  Otherwise a good experience if you have to be there.
"	2
Doctor Nielson has been my wife's cardiologist for 14 years, and just recently helped me her husband with a heart related problem. Always treated with kindness, very frank in discussing medical situations, and extremely caring.  	2
I had an initial appointment with Dr. Nielson and it was one of the best doctor visits I've ever had.  I arrived early and the nurse took me back 10 minutes before by scheduled appointment.  I thought it would just be a 30 minute visit to establish a relationship; however, they quickly did an EKG and obtained a thorough health history.  Dr. Nielson took all the time I wanted to discuss my health, concerns, and to educate me about my heart.  I am happy I took this step in my personal health care.	2
Dr. Nielson exudes competence and attentiveness.  He listens.  I am a new patient, and just these two attributes together make me feel safe in his care.  	2
My husband and I are both patients of Dr Nielson.  We would highly recommend him, his staff and nurses are excellent.  My brother is now a patient and very pleased with entire office.  	2
My consultation with Dr. Nielson was useful and greatly appreciated.  He is providing excellent care for my heart condition.	2
I have trusted Dr. Nielson since my first visit to his office, then located in the Alta View Hospital complex.  He has always treated me with respect, concern for my feelings and has stuck with a problem I would be experiencing until a resolution was reached.  My symptoms have changed (improved) greatly over the years.  Dr. Nielson has changed my medication as my symptoms have changed.  I would, and have, certainly recommended Dr. Nielson to anyone who was experiencing a heart problem.	2
Dr Nielsen was on time for my appointment, never made me feel rushed, and was clearly knowledgeable about his specialty. I highly recommend him as a heart specialist. 	2
Dr Murtaza is the best!!! If you're unlucky to have a heart problem you will be lucky to have him as your doctor.	2
Dr. Murtaza has performed multiple stent operations 4 in the last 3 years. My recovery time was quick. He explains what is happening  and speaks to you during the procedure to make sure that you have no discomfort. Then checks up on you after the procedure to explain what he did and make sure you are feeling well. He has a good bedside manor which is lacking in many of his colleagues.  He is a caring surgeon. 	2
"Kind, compassionate, great bedside manner. Easy to talk to and he explains things very well. 
Nurses and staff are great.
Highly recommend."	2
I have great respect for and confidence in Dr Dieck.  I have recommended him to others and will continue to do so.	2
Dr. Dieck took as much time as I needed but didn't dilly-dally taking more of my time than needed. I appreciate his getting right to the point and listening to me.	2
"Dr. Dieck leaves this long-term patient with confidence that he's closely following my heart problem and has access to whatever medical diagnostic tools are appropriate to monitor my situation. Test facilities are modern. 
Billing/Insurance management is never a problem.
The doctor's staff is easy to work with and competent. Appointments are generally easy to get. 
The office is attractive and clean and rarely too busy. Easy to recommend."	2
The entire visit was fine, no problems with the Dr. of staff.	2
On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest - I would give him a 10. One of the best doctors ever and his Nurse Debbie Hardin ranks a 10 too.  I recommend both of them all of the time!	2
I’ve been seeing Dr Dieck for about 10 years and he and his staff have always been prompt, efficient, courteous and just nice people.  I’m not particularly thrilled about going to the doctor, but they make it more than bearable.  An odd review, but it’s what I got.	2
Dr. Dieck is the best.  He listens to you, doesn't rush you, answers all your questions, and laughs at your dumb jokes!  I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Dieck to anyone who wants a professional, caring, and knowledgeable cardiologist.	2
"Dr. Dieck always takes his time to listen to me and answer any questions I might have.
I wouldn't want to ever find a new doctor. I'm extremely happy with him, even my primary doctor said if she needed a cardiologist she would choose Dr. Dieck."	2
Simply the best doctor I have had caring attention to my needs and concerns 	2
"Dr Dieck is a wonderful and caring Dr. He took care of my mother and dad and now helping me !  He is very experienced with a great bedside manner and an expert in numerous heart conditions !  I would definitely refer him to friends and others !
Thanks, Elaine "	2

Dr Dieck is a professional, knowledgeable and kind man. There is never a time that I haven’t been pleased. You never leave his office wondering what was wrong with you. You understood everything.

Dr. Dieck and staff take the time to listen to all we had to say regarding my husband's treatment.    We left Dr. Dieck knowing we had found a doctor that truly cared for the welfare of his patients.   Thank you Dr. D	2
Dr Dieck has a very impressive background.My husband and I have been his patients for years.He is a very caring, thorough and friendly physician. He is very observant and carefully checks out anything we tell him.	2
Very knowledgeable and friendly Doc surrounded by an equally knowledgeable and friendly staff. Calls are returned in a timely manner. Great heart doc and a great guy!!	2
"I heartily  recommend Dr. John Dieck and his staff  at Texas Heart.  Everyone there has been kind, expert in patient care, and their office is easy to get to and from and park.  I feel secure in Dr Dieck's care and professional knowledge.
Joan Mays"	2
"Dr. Dieck was highly recommended by Dr. Ari Mortazavi (Chief of Cardiology
at Kelsey- Seybold  with St. Lukes in Houston.  We found him to be very friendly,
with a great ""bedside Manner"" and assessed everything with a new patient
exam and prior records for both my husband and myself.  First impressions are very important and we feel that we are in ""GOOD
HANDS"".
 "	2
Dr. Dieck is a very caring and experienced health care provider who clearly explains test results and any symptoms you may present.   Unlike some specialists, he's quite personable and easy to talk to.  	2

"Would never use anyone else. 12 years and he still cares how I am! I recommend
him to everyone."	2
I suffered a heart attack on Dec 7,2018 and was taken to St. David's S. Austin Hospital by ambulance.  Dr. Dieck was the attending physician and acted swiftly by performing the required procedures.  He informed my family members in a caring and professional manner.  In a follow-up appointment he took time to answer any and all questions that my wife, daughter and I had for him.  I am indebted to him and have full confidence in him.	2
"I’ve been a patient of Dr. Dieck’s for over ten years and he is the best physician I have.  He always patiently listens to my concerns, and answers my questions with care and expertise.  And he is genuinely a nice person.

 Dr. Dieck is not only a brilliant cardiologist, he is also warm, kind, and understanding.  He truly cares about his patients and knows our hearts both physically and spiritually.  	2

Several Cardiology Professionals recommended him highly.. Therefore I continued to go to him. Over the years, I have had several heart incidents and Dr. Dieck has handled them successfully.

I became a patient of Dr. Dieck after a very bad experience with another cardiologist with a different medical service three years ago. The difference was like day and night as far as the care and understanding I received were concerned.  In my three years with Texas Cardiovascular, I have received nothing less than the best in knowledgeable service and care.  Dr. Dieck is the very best and I would not trade him for all the other cardiologists in Austin.. 	2
It was reasonably quick and efficient as far as the wait time was concerned. the preliminary exam was well done and pleasant. The visit with the doctor was informative and pleasant. I was given a normal bill of health which pleased me a lot.	2

Went to Rio Grande Valley Cardiology to check on my heart problem that I was having. Dr. Enslein and staff were very nice and made me feel confrontable and took my worries away. I would recommend RGV Cardiology to family and friends.	2
I love the service and attention given to me by the staff and the doctor at every visit I have. Dr Enslein has been my doctor for at least ten years or more. He saved my life. He noticed that I was too young for all my heart troubles. Stroke(2000) 45 years old, heart attack(2006) 51 years old. He refered me to the McAllen Heart Hospital. In 2012 I got a pacemaker and I now live a semi-nornal life. Thank you Dr Enslein.	2

I have always received excellent care and service with Dr Jeremy Enslein and his staff. He came highly recommended by my best friend. I now highly recommend him and his staff as well.  I have all the intentions of remaining with my cardiologist and will continue to recommend him and his office	2
"Dr Enslein was so caring and attentive while I was in the hospital in TX .  He did everything he could to make sure my heart was not infected and also he called in  Dr Lema the pulmonologist  because of my severe asthma
problems as well as pneumonia.  After I left the hospital I had a 2 week follow up in his office.  He wanted to be sure that my home heart DR in PA knew everything that occured during my 8 day stay in the hospital. I am a Winter Texan and care away from my home in PA is important"	2
I have consulted with Dr. Enslein several times during the last few years, so has my wife one time. He has ordered an EKG and an Echogram.

During that time I was scheduled a surgery and needed clearance for Surgery called for 2 days requesting that clearance ( hospital called also) the front office said at each call the Dr and Nurse we're not available. Surgery postponed. Dr I have faith. Front office no way. I'm leaving practice after 10 years. Can't trust office. Dr said he could do nothing. Appointment today not friendly. Wasn't seen by my Dr.	0

Dr. Enslein is an excellent doctor who cares about his patients. He takes the time to listen and gives feed back on whatever questions or concerns you have. The staff is excellent and very polite.  When I am scheduled for a visit the longest I have waited is 5 to 10min. I highly recomed Dr. Enslein if you are looking for heart doctor who cares about his patients. 	2
It was so nice to meet a doctor that made you feel like he really cared how you feel and that he wanted to help.  It seems in our society today that type of doctor is not found as often as it used to.  I would highly recommend him for your heart problems.  I thank him for making me feel so at ease and so welcome.	2
Having numerous heart related problems over the last ten years, it has been important to have the most qualified and best cardiologist to manage these problems.

I enjoyed my most recent visit and appreciated the prompt and friendly attention I received.  Dr Enslein was kind enough to generate a letter of medical clearance while I waited.  I was impressed!  Also, it is worth noting that I did not have to wait months to be seen....unlike many of the interlnal medicine folks I have been trying to get an appointment with.   I have been a patient of Dr Enslein since 2006 and am pleased he doesn't waste my time or money with unnecessary tests.  ??	2

Both my husband and I have been treated with the utmost respect by not only him but also his entire staff.

I have and will continue to recommend him to all my friends and family!"	2

My cardiologist was on vacation and I needed to see someone.  Dr. Dang worked me in on short notice and I was very impressed with her.

I love Dr. Dang. She is very professional, friendly, goes into detail about the tests that are done and explains the results and answers all my questions in a way that I can understand which I appreciate. She took care of my husband and remembered my family. She welcomed us like we were family, remembered our names, etc which put us at ease. I highly recommend Dr. Dang to anyone looking for a wonderful, caring doctor.	2
The Doctor was very personable and knowledgeable. I'm glad she is my new cardiologist.	2
"Dr. Dang is a wonderful doctor.  She always explains things about my treatment.  I feel very comfortable talking to her.  She has such a great personality.

"	2
Dr. Dang is a fantastic heart doctor, she gives you that bed side manner with her caring ways. I highly recommend her. Appointments are on time. Not a lot of waiting. Clean environment and friendly staff. Always gives me a computer report with all my numbers and readings on it. Comes in very handy.  Try her and be comfortable with visiting her. She will make you feel comfortable with her sweet and warm ways.	2
She's thorough, she listens and is very personable.  She also recommends the least invasive procedure first.  Dr. Dang was recommended to us by another physician.  We love her think she's awesome.  We also love her nurse, April!  She's thorough, receptive and always returns calls promptly.	2
Dr. Berry is truly one of the best Doctor fits for our family. His follow up and compassion for his patients sets him apart from the rest. Dr. Berry has been the cardiologist for both of my parents and treats them like they are his:) He has been there for them both through heart attacks and false alarms. He is a true asset to the practice and profession. We need more like him!!!! We consider him family:)	2
Had the first visit with Dr. Berry this am after a short wait in the patient area.  Vitals were taken, medications checked  then an electrocardiogram.  While still in the same room Dr. Berry reviewed my medical history, performed a cardio physical check and asked questions about my meds/health.  He explained my conditions and asked for concerns. We scheduled echo in the same building in a couple weeks and a follow-up pending the echo results.   I left very pleased with the hour visit.	2
Dr Johnson has a big shout out from me.  I had two surgeries in the past 6 months and both were with amazing results.  Professional and courteous is beyond words, my surgeries were breast reconstruction from past breast cancer and then a hernia I  just became aware of.   Good outcome and yes I highly refer Dr. Johnson.	2
He was very pleasant and professional. He explained everything in detail and took time to really listen and offer easy to understand explanations of procedures.	2
Professional and courteous, Dr. Johnson is a high quality surgeon with an affable manner that puts you right at ease. After a year and a half of working with him for reconstruction following cancer removal and breast reduction, he continues to be just as attentive as he was on day one. He *listens* to you before offering options. This does make him run late on appointments, but keep in mind that he'll give you the same service! I will be a loyal patient for years to come.	2
"I had lost 100#'s and had underarm flaps that were about 4"" long, plus my stomach had loose skin.  He did an amazing job on my stomach it looks perfect.  Dr. Johnson made a new hole in my skin and stitched the skin over the belly button.  Looks perfect!  I have had 2 months and the swelling and thickness of my stomach are almost normal. Hooray!!!  The biggest problem is having patience.

Dr. Rock is an amazing surgeon. He’s very personal able and his sense of humor is most welcome when facing surgery. He has don’e two surgeries on me and I will seek him out if I ever need a future one. 	2
I went to Dr.Rock after a biopsy came back benign but atypical ductal.  He ultrasounded the area that was biopsied and that lump was gone but I mentioned that I had another lump.  He said it was either a sweat gland or lymph node which are both normal objects in a persons body and that he would not biopsy it.  So I asked him well who would and he said no one.  I’m going elsewhere, he’s incorrect.  This site notes in his procedures that he does biopsy lymph nodes.  	0
Dr. Rock did not go the extra step to biopsy a lump that was there for two years. Had he just biosped, we would have found the breast cancer earlier. Instead recommended I come back in a year.  Now more extensive cancer treatments are needed once a biopsy was done. Would have been a lot easier if with an earlier diagnosis.  Also, front office was very rude when trying to make an appt.  Told me I could have an appt 1.5 months later. Thankfully, went to a different doctor and now in treatment. 	0
I'm leaving a review for the care I saw my mom got. Sheis amazing. From the time she was diagnosed,  other tests and surgery was done within 3 weeks. After the surgery she was always checking in on her before she was discharged.  She is caring, patient and that is all you need sometimes. 	2
Simply put, she saved my life. We@ beat breadt cancer 7 years ago.	2
Was referred by several Doctors to Dr.Chen when I was diagnosed with IDC  was a very stressful time ,needed much advice and information! Dr. Chen took the time to explain and explore different options that I had ! She also put me in touch with my plastic surgeon Dr. Jonathan Bank ! It’s almost six months after my double mysectomy with DIEP Flap surgery the cancer was removed and it had not spread! I’m still recovering and can’t say enough about the devotion to her patients,she made it doable!	2
LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr.Chen. She's amazing! I've been her patient since I was 17 years old (now 23) and she never disappoints. She truly cares about her patients and after a procedure she will contact you in any way she can to see if you're feeling OK. She is one of few doctors I can say that I fully have trust, comfort and confidence in! 	2
A great surgeon who has the experience, knowledge, responsiveness (always gets back to you) and compassion and empathy...hard to find all in one but Dr. Chen has it all.  I wouldn't hesitate in seeing Dr, Chen.  Also, she explains things impeccably well and will support you all the way! I had a lumpectomy with Dr, Chen in May, 2016	2
All I can say, she's the best.	2
Recently had surgery done by Dr. Gefen.  I wish I could give him 50 stars!!  No complications, minimal scarring and wonderful bedside manner.  I can't say enough good things about him and his professionalism.	2
I had severe Cholecystitis and needed my gallbladder removed. I had one surgeon actually tell me that i needed to wait a week to have it removed and that i would be fine with meds until then. I was not fine.  I went to the ER at Lankenau and was admitted.  Dr Gefen removed my gallbladder and the next day i was almost back to normal.  I felt like a new woman and healed with no scarring .  Thank you for givnig me back my quality of like.	2
I'm 47 yrs old. This was my first time having surgery. I was very nervous about  the procedure and being put under anesthesia. But Dr Gefen made me feel at ease. He even told me to give him a call the day before the operation if I was still nervous. The morning of the procedure I arrived at the hospital Dr Gefen and his staff greeted me and made me feel very comfortable. He reassured me everything was going to be fine. The operation was a success. Dr Gefen is skilled and he cares so much.	2
Dr Gefen I had seen many years back regarding a hernia operation At the time I was told to wait . So this January 2017 I had a double hernia operation performed by Dr Gefen and his surgical team . They were all just wonderful helping me through my operation . I strongly recommend if you need surgery for a hernia Dr Gefen is the surgeon for you The nurses and other doctors  were fantastic and I thank All Of You who helped me through my operation. May God Bless You All.	2
Excellent physician!  I recently had Dr. Gefen preform a hernia repair.  He was personable and professional. Although, I was nervous and dreading having this surgery, Dr. Gefen and his team set me as easy and the surgery was better than I could have imagined! I would highly recommend Dr. Gefen to any friends & family!  	2
Great guy, professional, awesome surgeon.  Went over and beyond to repair my bilateral inguinal hernia~	2
"Super highly recommend, I had a robot assisted sigmoid colectomy in May 2019. It went way better than I expected. Dr. Kurtin and staff where so nice and Professional at what they do. I recovered fast and back on my feet just hours after surgery, for me with very little pain. I was and still so amazed at the recovery time after such an operation by Dr. Kurtin. 
  Thanks Dr. Kurtin and staff for being there from consultation to the follow ups after surgery.
“Great Team”"	2
Great surgeon. I Highly recommend Dr. Kurtin	2
Dr. Kurtin is very knowledgeable and kind.  He listens to my concerns and puts me at ease.  The ladies there are also wonderful.  I moved from NY to Port St. Lucie and feel grateful to have found this office!	2
I recently had a very positive experience with Dr. Adam Kurtin at Treasure Coast Surgical Specialists.  I was taken in right away and first met with Dr. Hernandez, a resident who is doing a rotation there.  My wife is anxious about my impending procedure and he made her feel at ease.  Dr. Kurtin came in shortly after and gave and extremely detailed description of what needs to be done in terms that we could understand.  He didn't rush us through the process and answered all of our questions.	2
he was very professional and my surgery went without a hitch, minimal scars and very little pain after the surgery, and my wounds have healed beautifully , I can recommend him with complete confidence .	2
Dr. Kurtin is an extraordinarily skilled surgeon and a very caring and compassionate physician. In addition to my personal experience as his patient, I have found that he is highly respected among his colleagues. I would recommend, him without hesitation, to anyone looking for a general surgeon. 	2
I was impressed with my visit to Dr.Kurtin's office for a pre-op exam.  His Office staff was very professional and friendly.  After the examination, Dr. Kurtin explained what my options were, what the procedures are, and the benefits of each.   Dr. Kurtin was very reassuring and I am confident that the procedure will be successful.  	2
Dr. Kurtin is a wonderful and caring physician.  	2
I had no problem choosing Dr. Kurtin, he performed flawless and successful procedures on both my wife and my father. Dr. Kurtin is very courteous, knowledgeable and skilled. His staff and facility fall right in line with his great example. Dr. Kurtin is everything you hope a Dr. would be. And my procedure was a 100% success, I had no doubt it would be anything less. Thank you Dr. Kurtin and staff.	2
"Dr kurtin is excellent. Professional and immediate. I woyld certainly recommend him
"	2
Wow... is all I can say.   Saw dr Kurtin after many years of not feeling well. He got me on the right track and I'm feeling like myself again.  Warm and friendly staff too.   Thank you Dr Kurtin 	2
Had major surgery September 29th.  I could.not say enough good about this man.  Such a skille surgeon, patient and compassionate person.  No one has ever put me at ease better.  He is a great person ansd of you ever have the need choose no other.  This man is fabulous.  	2
What a wonderful man,  My 91 year old mother was under his care for 2 weeks at SLMC.  He was not aggressive and tried his best to help us avoid surgery.  After 3 days of still having issues he performed abdominal surgery.  He was in and out of the OR as quickly as he could  and came directly to the recovery room to speak with me.  He is a kind, caring, compassionate healthcare professional.. As a RN myself I attest to his character.	2
Waited to see him for my condition but it was well worth the wait.  Had survey and everything went well.  Extremely pleased.	2
Not only is Dr. Kurtin an excellent surgeon; he is a very kind and caring person.	2
I had some horrible ugly veins removed by Dr. Nelson. The doctor and her staff did a wonderful and professional job start to finish. 	2
For the past 5 years, I have been dealing with painful, swollen legs. I had previously gone to a few other vascular surgeons but was not satisfied with their treatment approaches. Dr. Nelson and her team offered a simple, non-invasive way to treat my legs and make me finally feel good again! Dr. Nelson and her staff were extremely professional and knowledgable towards my condition. My phlebectomy procedure on both legs was conducted in the office and I was able to go out to dinner afterwards!	2
"Went to dr nelson what a rip off . When I made appointment I asked about my insurance covering my visit, I was assured it would be covered.  Dr Nelson did nothing for me except a ultrasound on my legs.  Then I got a bill for $677.00 my insurance will not cover this visit.
Good thing I did not do the follow up visit that they insisted was necessary."	1
"Hands down the smartest most caring Doctor I have ever met!! 
"	2
Wonderful doctor. Great breast surgeon. Saved my life. Smart, kind, professiona. Cares about her patientsl. BEVERLY HORNICK	2
I cannot say enough about Dr Reed. I met he after getting horrible, scary news. I left her office with such a sense of peace. She made me feel like I was in the best hands possible and it turns out I was. She is straightforward and real. A truly gifted surgeon	2
My experience with her was great. I had her for breast cancer with double mastectomy. She is knows her stuff and makes you feel comfortable. I highly recommend her!	2
"Fast talker, bristles at your concerns. Argumentative, must have the last word. Period. Unaware of HRT & how they effect you pre/post-surgery. Hurried and flippant about your concerns post-surgery. She becomes offended & combative when questioned with extremely VITAL issues. She then notes it in her charts that it's your attitude, not hers, ever. DOESN'T LISTEN. VERY AUTHORITATIVE. CONDESCENDING. She is not for you if need a warm, attentive,thoughtful,
kind, respectful and well mannered doctor."	2
An absolutely amazing person with the heart of gold and hands of an Angel. I am forever grateful to Dr.Jennifer Reed for my successful surgery and everything that she has done for me during my breast cancer treatment journey. Dr. Reed LISTENS to the patient and incorporates her/his wishes into the surgery and treatment. Thank you Dr. Jennifer!	2
So caring, attentive and articulate. Detail oriented above and beyond all expectations. Wonderful bedside manner. Helped the whole family feel relaxed. Came down in his scrubs as soon as he was finished to find my family in the waiting room and debrief them on my condition after hernia surgery. They did not see any other doctor come into the waiting room like Dr Powers did. Humble, tuned in and kind. 	2
"I was quite pleased with just about everything today during my visit.  Dr. Powers was fully descriptive, informative and capable of the minor surgery he performed for me today.
Mary Falco"	2
Dr. Powers has fantastic medical experience and knowledge, his bedside manner, his care and concern about any and all concerns can be matched by very few. He leaves no stones unturned in presenting the good, the bad and the ugly in a surgical situation, he is very easy to talk to, he is a good listener and can be a really good friend to have. Put your trust in him and you will surely be glad you did.	2
There are no words to explain Dr.powers services and work. My name is Rose Cruz and he did a Surgery on my mother Lillian Ramos . I traveled from Far Rockaway ny just to have him do my moms procedure. With that it can show you that we were so happy the day we came inside for a consultation that the same day we scheduled her surgery . Not only were we happy about his services but we were grateful that we did not have to ask so many question. They were answered the same day . May godbless you! 	2
3/30/2017. My daughter just had umbilical chord Hernia - DR POWERS is the best doctor I've met in my lifetime - so detailed from A to Z no questions left for me to ask.  Thank you Dr. Powers.  	2
Dr. Powers is a very skilled surgeon. In addition he takes the time to answer any questions you might have and explains everything in detail. I highly reccomend him.	2
I have the utmost confidence in Dr.Powers and would recommend him to any of my friend or family.	2
Absolutely love Dr Powers! His professionalism, knowledge, bedside manner...just the best! I would highly recommend Dr. Powell, and I don't like to recommend doctors. 	2
Awesome surgeon. He was amazing with my family	2
Followed him from the Keys to his current location north. Wouldn’t think of using anyone else. He’s the best!	2
He was the kindest doctor I have ever met and made me and my dad feel so comfortable. The staff was amazing too.	2
My experience with Dr Donkor is out of this world excellent costumer service everyone in the office is so professional this is a second time I have the surgery with Dr Donkor and I have nothing to say about Him in a negative way He’s part of my life because of this Man I’m here for my family thank you very much and God Bless you!!!!!!	2
"Wonderful experience.  Very professional.  Concerned Dr.  Happy to have seen him
"	2
Dr. Donkor came highly recommended, and my own experience with him and his office staff validated the glowing praise I’d heard. Donkor is a skilled surgeon with a compassionate bedside manner. His nursing staff and office administrators were equally efficient and attentive.	2
"Excellent care from not only Dr Donkor but his whole office staff, including Karla and Orinthia!
 From the very moment I walked in the office I felt safe and confident that I made the right decision. Wonderful professionalism and care, they took me on a short notice as I work out of the country and my time was limited in Fort Lauderdale. Surgery was excellent and the staff at Westside regional Hospital was also top-notch. "	2
Dr. Donkor was very professional and answered all my concerns.  His office staff in Plantation was nice.	2
I had gallbladder removal with Dr. Donkor and I could not have picked a better surgeon. He was kind and informative and his staff are excellent.	2
Great doctor and great stuff clean office excellent experience 	2
Excellent!!! . Very professional and friendly.	2
"Very professional and his office staff is also ""best to none..."".
Thanks for your time and attention with me and my mother during our visit.
"	2
Dr.  Dankor was great dealing with me today.  	2
I had inguinal hernia surgery with mesh and I have to say that I am amazed at how good I feel. There was very little pain after the surgery and that tells me I was blessed to have Dr. Donkor taking care of me. Both he and his staff are wonderful people.	2
Thank you Dr Donkor and your team, i wont hesitate to refer you to others. Caring and passionate about your patient health and wellbeing before and after surgery. Again thank you a lot.	2
excellent surgeon. would recommend to family and friends	2
I consulted with Dr. Donkor, about a gallbladder problem and I found him to be very knowledgeable, and thorough in his approach to medicine. He was very patient, and seemed truly concerned about my issues and what we could do to rectify the situation 	2
I love my doctor he is amazing at what he does. His knowledge and experience is amazing. He performed surgery and it was a successful operation. Thanks to Dr. Donkor for your support. 	2
I recently had a surgery done by Dr.Donkor which was successful to the area .He is a compassionate and excellent Doctor and knows what he is doing .I wish him prosperity in his career.	2
My 70 year old mother had to go into emergency surgery for hernia and colon blockage. Given her age and other health complications, we were very concerned. Dr. Donkor was just amazing, not in just how smoothly the surgery went, but in how comforting he was to my mother who was extremely  nervous and spoke very little English. She was scheduled to be transferred to the ICU for post-op recovery, but the surgery went so well that they sent her directly to the general ward. My mother was up and abou	2
Amazing office staff! Dr Donkor is a wonderful doctor and made me comfortable to discuss my concerns.	2
Very friendly doctor, great bedside manner. Explained everything to me in detail before the surgery. He spoke with my spouse and my brother-in-law who is also a surgeon and was very kind and patient with them.	2
Dr , Donkor is a excellent, he a good person, good doctor , he recently save my life , did gallbladder removal robotic surgery, i am so glad i choose him , great experience and very professional thanks doctor donkor , God bless you  	2
Dr. Donkor was excellent in helping me understand what’s going with my body. He listened and offered many options for treatment. He is compassionate and gave me complete confidence in his ability to care for me. 	2
I been with Dr. Charan Donkor since April 45th 2013.. He is the most amazing person I have ever meet. His performed my double Mastectomy and has done several other surgeries on me. I would never leave him. He listens to you and is never in a rush to leave you without unanswered questions. He saved my life. And I will never forget that. Thank you Dr. Donkor..  Always in my heart. Diana Mendez Hernandez. Your an Angel	2
He was excellent. I was very anxious with it being my first surgery and he put me at ease. The surgery went very well and my recovery was under a week. My scars are minimal. He is very good at what he does. 	2
Dr.Donkor saved my life and i Thank God everyday he was in the right hospital literly at the right time. 	2
 I am one week postop and could not be happier with my results. Other than a little pain muscle spasms and some gas everything is going as expected, due to the excellent education and training I had from doctor Naziri and his team. Thanks Doc. Phillip. 	2
He is wonderful. He is so personable. 	2
I loved my surgeon, but the office is annoying to deal with.  There are many other surgeons in the area who will be more accommodating.  Southern Surgical makes you feel like you can't get the same level of service anywhere else.  They send you to an internal group of specialists who regularly ping your insurance for rates that are often ABOVE the allowed amount that my insurance will pay... and I have really good insurance.  It seems like a fat farm where the doctors involved in the referral 	0
Dr. Paul Morrissey is the absolute best in his field and I highly recommend him.  He provides excellent information for both pre and post surgical procedures and you will have, as I have had, complete and total confidence in Dr.Morrissey.	2
"Dr Wang is an excellent surgeon, my surgery went very well and I highly recommend him, and I would definitely use him again if it became necessary.


"	2
Dr Wang performed an Fundoplication for my chronic acid reflux GERD. Dr Wang is highly professional, takes time and explains, but mostly projects this confidence in what he is doing which gives much needed reassurance. His bedside manners are impeccable and his aftercare very thorough and effective. I highly recommend him for any surgery you might be considering. His back office, specifically Laura is extremely efficient and effect. Great experience all around.	2
I highly recommend Dr. Wang as your surgeon. He recently removed my gall bladder using robotic surgery. He puts you at ease and takes away any nerves you may have. He is simply brilliant in his field. Best of all, he makes me laugh...awesome personality!	2
"Dr Wang,Bless your whole family and the treasures of Happiness be with you!
May the Gods be with you, if there is only one.
Sincerely, my grads and your whole family too.
Love,
Timothy James Wigert"	2
In January 2019, Dr. Peter C. Wang met with me regarding some issues I had with a diverticulitis flare up.  For the next several months, we met several times  and discussed next steps.    He was thorough, personable, addressed all concerns I had and I felt I was in good hands.   After the surgery, he followed up with me, gave me all the pertinent information regarding the process and recovery.  I recommend him for surgery. A very good doctor.	2
"I can without reservation recommend surgeon, Dr. Peter Wang.  He has performed 2 surgeries on me over the years.  Some years ago, it was for gall bladder and most recently for an inguinal hernia.
I arrived in the morning and was home by the early afternoon.  Dr. Wang used robotic assisted surgery technique.  After surgery I had only three small one-inch incisions… no stitches.  The incisions were glued perfectly together… virtually painless.  I took OTC medication the first day or two, but no pain medication after that.  Though I had an Rx for pain, I never used or needed it.
I was a bit tired and sleepy after the surgery, so I rested and napped, but I went to work the next day in the afternoon virtually pain free.  Though there were minor twinges of sensation in the hernia area. They rated only a 1 on a scale of 10.
If you are looking for a great surgeon you should contact Dr. Peter Wang.  I can highly recommend his surgical expertise and personable, pleasant & confident demeanor."	2
"I love this guy & I say it like that with total respect for him & his profession. He calls it like it is & is very candid to where you can understand what's going on. He has a gentle nature that is very refreshing. My health challenge & the consequences of my condition was explained in detail. My surgery was an elective one and he gave me an understanding of it that helped me with an easy decision. It impressed me that he did not try to push the procedure on me. The procedure was easy for me and the days after made me think as if there had been no surgery. He's a very special Doctor and brings a ton of credibility to his profession and the Hoag community. 

Thank you for your help Dr. Wang & for being there.

"Dr Wang did a fantastic job of removing my gallbladder which was in very bad shape.
I would highly recommend his services.
Not only a great surgeon but a great person.
A winning combination."	2
Recently had an umbilical hernia repair surgery done by Dr. Wang, it went perfectly, there could have been some complications due to my liver condition, but due to his skill and care there was none, it was great, myself, my wife,  my GP doctor, and others were impressed. Use Dr. Wang if you can!	2
"Dr Wang saved my mother's life and helped her regain her confidence too! 

After a sudden ruptured diverticula along with a pelvic abscess and multiple non-invasive attempts to cure her, we had no choice but to proceed with a partial colectomy on my 85 y/o mom right around Thanksgiving. Dr Wang's skill and thorough attention took her through this surgery with great care. And, 5 months later, he was able to successfully reverse an ileostomy just in time for her to attend her only daughter's wedding! Needless to say, we are extremely grateful to Dr Wang, the surgical staff at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, CA and the office staff, Priscilla, Laura, Chris and Rachel at Newport Irvine Surgical Specialists. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND them!"	2
Dr. Wang took the time to discuss the surgery I was going to have and what to expect. He entertained all questions to insure My wife and I were at ease. The abdominal wall reconstruction was incredibly successful not only repairing the hernias, but tightening my very week abdominal muscles. What may or may not be common for others have this surgery is that, for me, the pain I was experiencing for almost 2 years is gone! at this point I am completely satisfied with Dr. Wang's minimally invasive robotic surgery! 	1
Dr. Wang took out my appendix, which was in pretty (very) bad shape, and I was in the hospital for 7 days as a result.  It was my first surgery and I'm so grateful that Dr. Wang was assigned to me.  He is exceptionally skilled, competent and knowledgeable.  Despite the extensive infection and sepsis caused by my (gangrenous) appendix, I recovered completely and without issue under his care and was back at work within a couple of weeks.  I felt that he and his nurse genuinely cared about me and my recovery and frequently checked on me in the hospital.  I will be calling Dr. Wang should I ever need a surgeon in the future.	2
"Last month Dr. Wang performed a second surgery on me...I can say, ""he's 'saved' me twice""!  I enjoy his professionalism, excellent exchange of information on the procedures, courteous attitude, and great sense of humor... He's truly a superb surgical ""artist"" with robotic and laparoscopic surgeries.  I'm very happy to recommend Dr. Wang"	2
"Dr. Wang is an experienced surgeon who also has that special ""sixth sense"" to go beyond just known data to address his clients' issues; that comes from his extensive experience."	2
Dr Wang did a 7 (seven) hour hernia repair on me which turned out perfect. During my stay at the hospital he took very good care of me. He actually cared about my health. He takes great pride in his work. In my opinion he is absolutely AMAZING. His post op care is excellent. I can not express how truly amazing this doctor is.	2
I am blessed to have had Doctor Peter C Wang preform a colorectal surgery on me.  All(100%) of the cancerous tumor was removed and a beautifully functioning Stoma was created, (which will be reversed in about four weeks from now).  Doctor Wangs team and staff was very accommodating with every one of my concerns addressed and questions answered.  Doctor Wang and his staff carried me through this journey with positive reinforcement and professionalism.  Doctor Wang knows how to communicate extremely well.  I was never left hanging.	2
Dr. Wang is such a skillful robotic surgeon that he was able to perform a needed left colectomy on me with only 5 tiny scars, 3-day hospital stay, no blood loss, no leaks, no complications.  I even returned to work part-time after only 2 weeks.	2
Peter C. Wang M.D. is an exceptional surgeon.  I have had two robotic surgical procedures performed by Dr. Wang.  There were no problems or issues after the procedures, due to his exceptional skills.  While I was in the hospital, his numerous visits were unexpected, but greatly appreciated.  He was patient in answering all questions posed by my wife and myself.  My family and I hold Dr. Wang in very high regards.	2
"Following surgery for prostate cancer by another surgeon on 3/18/19, I was re admitted to Hoag on 3/20/19 with a massive bowel blockage. Enter Dr. Wang who performed life saving surgery.
Not only is he an amazing surgeon, he has a calming, professional manner that assured me I was in competent hands. My condition was serious. I remained in Hoag for three weeks.
This is the doctor that got me through it and this is the doctor I would recommend to everyone."	2
I had emergency surgery for a bowel obstruction and could not have been more lucky to have Dr. Peter Wang assigned to my case.  He is accessible, answered all my questions patiently and was an excellent surgeon.  His follow up has been great and his staff considerate and helpful.	2
Do not recommend - get other opinions before you commit to this person. Horrible office staff.  	0
This is my 2nd review after robotic mesh repair/ lipoma removal surgery by Dr Wang. I waited 8 months to write this 2 nd review  it has taken me this long to recover to almost normal. I had several hernias repaired  & a tumor removed. I’m not young so it was a long recovery. Dr. Wang is kind & incredible an expert. I’m feeling almost normal again but it was slow goin. I am grateful to him & his staff as well as Hoag Hospital Newport for the great care & kindness they gave me. HE IS THE BEST!!	2
Dr. Wang is truly excellent.   Competent, caring, compassionate, and cool.  I can't say enough about this exemplary surgeon and doctor.	2
"Amazing bedside manner  and care for the patient??  Every question was answered and he never made you feel he needed to rush off… Even though he is extremely busy and an amazing surgeon. I would highly recommend Dr. Wang and his staff.  
 Above and beyond was their care and service. Five stars across-the-board ????
 Seek this doctor out

Dr. Wang came highly recommended by another good doctor who specializes in urology oncology. I'm very happy that I chose Dr. Wang for my splenectomy. He always made me feel comfortable and listened to all my questions and gave me direct, honest answers. He is obviously highly trained, intelligent, and he has a sense of humor that I appreciate.	2
"I have lived with gastric esophageal reflux disease for over 40 years before I was referred to Dr. Peter Wang. Dr. Wang performed Laparoscopic Surgery on November 29th, 2018 to repair the paraesophageal hernia and I have not had an acid reflux episode since. If you are considering LAP surgery, then Dr. Wang is the right doctor for you. I would highly recommend Dr. Wang to everyone.

Very professional. Provided easy to follow diagnosis. Very good surgeon.	2
"Dr. Wang is an excellent surgeon.  He helped guide us through a very complicated process after my appendix burst which left me with two abscesses. We were told by  family and friends in the medical field that Dr. Wang is “the best”...he is well known among other surgeons for his technical skills.  He was very easy to contact and very responsive.  We owe a lot to Dr. Wang who truly saved my life!
Also...his nurse practitioner, Laura, is amazing as well! "	2
Dr. Wang repaired my hernia recently, and I feel he did an outstanding job. I would gladly recommend him to others.	2
"Dr. Wang is an excellent surgeon.  He recently completed my hernia surgery and did a great job.  I had no trouble with recovery and have already referred him to others.  His bedside manner and communication skills were excellent.  He spent ample time making me feel comfortable and the surgery and recovery were exactly as he explained.
"	2
Dr Peter Wang saved my life in emergency surgery 9 years ago.  He is a compassionate, understanding and truly talented surgeon.  He takes the time to get to explain, listen and answer questions.  I have a chronic intestinal problem and know that I will need surgery sometime in the near future.  I can't say enough about how competent, precise and talented he is as a surgeon.  He performed the impossible on me in the past and I highly recommend and respect him.  He's an A+ surgeon and person! 	2
"I had a crazy  surgery. But Dr Wang was the man. Blessed to have him as my Dr. . 
Very honest tells you the truth and and goes above all other Dr. most Dr operates with there ego Dr. Wang operates with your needs in mind ... and years of knowledge. Thank God for his skilled hands. "	2
"My experience with Dr. Wang has been great. He operated on me about 2 months ago and the results were amazing. Also his bedside manner is very good too. I highly recommend him.
"	2
Doctor Wang did my diverticulitis surgery. I had no complications. Guided by his vast experience, I only lost the worst section of my colon that was diseased - no more, no less. I would highly recommend him for his surgical skill.	2
Dr. Wang corrected a complicated problem that had been causing me pain for months, and the pain is gone.  He and his staff were quick and efficient in arranging a time for my surgery.  At every visit he took the time to explain the situation and answered questions.  I am so glad I was referred to Dr. Wang.  	2
Dr. Peter Wang is an excellent and highly talented surgeon. His skills are state of the art. He explains everything in great detail. He is a surgeon who truly cares about his patients. His office staff is also great and very caring. I highly recommend Dr. Peter Wang.	2
"I was fortunate enough to have Dr. Wang employ state-of-the-art, minimally invasive ""robotic assisted"" surgery with fantastic outcome!  The surgery was performed without large incisions (as is routine with my diagnosis) supporting quicker healing and minimal pain. 
Dr. Wang has great communication skills which helped me understand the scope of the procedure in easy to understand terms.  This helped reduce the stress associated with surgery.  I was impressed with his energy level, and results!"	2
Dr. Peter C. Wang, is a very talented surgeon, the lord has blessed him with this great ability. To my misfortune, I have had a couple of surgeries performed by him. His skills are state of the art and his knowledge is up to date with the (World of Medicine). He is very clear and explains everything with detail, he is also a physician with a heart he does cares about his patients, he does have an amazing staff, ( Rachel and Kristy) are diligent and great, I definitely recommend him as  a surgeon	2
Dr. Peter Wang is an excellent surgeon and he is one of the few doctors in the country that have the ability to perform minimally invasive surgeries using robotic assistance.  My husband had a complicated incarcerated umbilical hernia and rectus diastasis that needed repair with mesh and we felt good that Dr. Wang was so confident in his abilities and he performed the surgery with great success!!   Thank you Dr. Wang…you are the BEST!!!	2
Dr Wang literally saved my life. I have been receiving chemo for breast cancer. After my 4th treatment I had excruciating pain in my left lower abdomen and called 911. I had immediate, extensive surgery. Later.  I found out that I had diverticulitis that perforated and developed sepsis. I am now 4 months post op and feeling terrific. Dr Wang spends time with you and answers all questions and eases your fears and concerns. I would highly recommend Dr. Wang. 	2
Dr. Wang is an excellent Surgeon, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone.  He performed 2 surgeries on my wife and we are very grateful to have him as her doctor.  His bedside manner might seem a little abrupt at first but as you get to know him you realize he is a very gifted surgeon that truly cares about your well being.	2
Dr. Peter C. Wang performed robotic bilateral Inguinal hernia surgery on me. He did an excellent job. He educated me very well on the procedure prior to the surgery. He trains other surgeons on robotic surgery. i have minimal scars and was able to perform my normal duties in two weeks. His office staffs at Irvine are very friendly and helpful. If I ever have any surgical need I will consider him first. I will definitely recommend him to any one. 	2
Informative consult, good surgical experience (if surgery can ever be considered good), relatively speedy recovery, and now very pleased with results.  Dr. Wang was very honest and reassuring throughout the process.  I would hignly recommend robotic hernia surgery by Dr. Peter Wang.	2
Dr. Wang and his staff are the best!  I was diagnosed last year with colorectal cancer and was referred to Dr. Wang by my GI.  I had 3 surgeries with Dr. Wang in 2017.  He did an amazing job with my lower anterior resection in April, and to remove my temporary ileostomy in December.  He also did a great job inserting my chemo port. My scars are very minimal for what I had done. I've never had any pain from my surgeries and they are healing very nicely.  Dr. Wang is a blessing in my life! 	2
"I was blessed to have Dr. Wang perform surgery on me!!!! 
I was rushed to Hoag Hospital for a perforated appendix ( ruptured appendix). Dr. Wang is truly a master surgeon his expertise is second to none with a stellar reputation! He was the only surgeon able to perform my surgery with a laparoscope! What touched me the most about Dr. Wang is his care, concern & compassion for his patients. He is an Angel and thanks to him I am alive! His office staff is incredible too! Highly recommend Dr. Wang!"	2
"I would absolutely recommend Dr. Wang. He is straightforward which I like as I am as well. Some want or need a doctor to coddle them. If you truly want to be fixed whatever your problem is Dr. Wang is the Dr.to go to bar none.
You might have to wait a while before he sees you because he is taking time with another patient don't get all upset he is going to spend that time with you so be patient!!!!!"	2
Dr Wang was very helpful during a time I was at Hoag. He did a procedure that basically saved my life. I had blockage from my stomach and my intestines and Dr. Wang did a bypass and reconnected my lower intestines to my stomach. That was 12 months ago and my digestive system was been working very well.	2
Dr Wang is the best. Explains all your options, did a phenomenal job on my surgery, makes himself available if you call with questions. The staff is great too.	2
After a terrible first experience of diverticulitis I was and two weeks in the hospital I was lucky to be introduced to Dr Wang. Two weeks post surgery for a robotic colon resection and I feel great.  Dr Wang takes the time to explain your condition and what the best procedure is and what to expect.  Could not ask for anything more. Always makes time to listen and answer questions. I did my research and second options. Clearly he is the best of the best!	2
Best surgeon for my needs!  Dr. Wang was called into consult for a life-threatening emergency. He provided solutions and explanations and monitored my condition over 2 weeks which later required his surgical skills.. Following this adventure, I returned for a different repair surgery. Surgery  and recovery were very easy due to Dr. Wang's excellent skills. I greatly appreciate the time, care, and concern for his patients. It is a pleasure to visit Dr. Wang and he has my highest recommendations.	2
Trustworthy. I felt extremely comfortable & at ease knowing this doctor would be removing the body & tail of my pancreas along with my spleen. My surgery was a success? I highly recommend Dr. Cashman. Pleasant, witty yet professional! An excellent surgeon.	2
"Dr Cashman is amazing. I know people use that word loosely, but he truly is AMAZING!!! 
He performed my liver surgery which involved other organs as well. His bedside manner is professional yet warm. I immediately got  the feeling that he was  genuinely concerned about my 
condition. He explained my situation in terms that I confidently understood. He also has a sense of humor which made my appointments so much easier. My surgical scar was minimal, which pleasantly surprised me. I give him an A+"	2
"Dr. Cashman is very professional, very smart, and a great person to be around with.  
My experience with Dr. Cashman was very pleasant and I would recommend him to anyone, that is in the process of a transplant.  
Dr. Cashman was my wife's doctor who perform a kidney transplant on the 17 of February 2017.
I can't thank him enough for the care he has rendered us. 
Thank You Dr. Cashman! 
"	2
I was referred to Dr Greenstein by my GI in New Jersey and I could not be happier I made the trip into the city to meet him. He was kind and patient at the consultation and managed to answer all of my questions before I even had the chance to ask him. It was so nice to meet a confident Doctor who was not arrogant!! The day of my surgery he and his team were awesome at keeping me comfortable and calm. After the surgery, he was amazing about checking in and keeping all of my questions answered (and there were many!!)  I have to say, he handled my procedure with care and kept me feeling great about it the whole time. I am now 3 weeks out and I could not be happier that I found him to do the procedure!! Even now his staff is awesome about returning calls and emails to answer all of my follow up questions. He did an amazing job with my surgery and I would recommend him to anyone who asked in a heartbeat!!	2
I can only say I've had I positive experience with Dr. Greenstein. Now 6 weeks post-op I feel much better. 6 weeks ago, when I entered the ED at Mt Sinai, Dr. Greenstein did not shy from taking-on what was a case with much uncertainty and potential for serious consequences. Dr. Greenstein's confidence was reassuring to me during these times, and not unfounded as the procedure went well, and frankly, I am here to write this review. During my time on the wards, I was visited by Dr. Greenstein or his team daily (who also I found to very helpful and pleasant). Despite a likely busy schedule, he was always open to answering my questions, clarify his decisions, and ease my uncertainty. Moreover, his office staff was very helpful in scheduling and diligent in responding to emails, as I needed school documentation completed. All-around, 100% recommend.	2
I would 100% recommend Dr. Greenstein to any family member or loved one that suffers from IBD. I was suffering for months with symptoms related to my Crohn’s Disease and when it came time for surgery, Dr. Greenstein was recommended to me and I could not have been happier with how my surgery went. His office staff i s highly attentive and all questions I had regarding pre and post op care were answered immediately by his Physician Assistant. While in the hospital, Dr. Greenstein’s team checked on me multiple times throughout the day. When it came to explaining what my procedure would entail, Dr. Greenstein took the time to answer all my questions regarding the procedure. 5 stars for all categories. I am very thankful I was recommended to him and his office. 	2
Dr. Greenstein is EXCELLENT.  I have Crohn's Disease and a stricture formed because I wasn't on medicine.  I was having obstructions every other day with severe abdominal pain and sometimes vomiting.  Dr. Greenstein operated on me.  I now feel GREAT!!!  I am on medicine now and we are hoping this will be in remission for the long-term.  Thank you Dr. Greenstein.  You are the best!!!!!!	2
A true professional. From explaining the procedure to performing the surgery Dr Greenstein gives you his full attention and quality of work.  I couldn't have asked for a better result.    	2
From the moment I met him, Dr. Greenstein put my mind at ease. He performed a three-step J pouch procedure as I had severe ulcerative colitis and was stuck on steroids. He walked  me through each step of the procedure, answered any questions I had and assured me I would feel much better. Before and after each surgical procedure, Dr. Greenstein was visible, caring, and supportive. I would highly recommend him	2
THE best surgeon!!  having had multiple abdominal surgeries with different doctors at different hospitals I am now not even 2 weeks post op after Dr Greenstein operated on me....I feel great!! He was confident about “fixing” my intestinal obstruction (complications from prior surgery) I thank him, Bari, The staff at Mt Sinai including my anesthesiologist, who I met just before surgery but treated me like he knew me! Incredibly pleased with Dr Alex Greenstein and am incredibly grateful. 	2
Great experience. Thoughtful, responsive and dedicated to his patients. Successful bowel resection for Crohn's Disease. 6 months out at this point, gaining weight and feeling well!	2
I had surgery by Alex Greenstein and had nothing but complications from him. I had a bowl reaction. Alex is a very nice man but not quite the surgeon. He’s more like quaintly over quality. He will staple your intestines back together and send you in your way with heavy issues. Right now another surgeon is going back in and cleaning up his mess. I wouldn’t recommend going to him	0
I'm a 40 yo man with a history of Crohn's Disease.   I had symptoms of an obstruction.  I went to the Mt. Sinai ER and quickly assigned to the IBD surgical team.  After tests,  they discovered that I had bowel intussusception, a small bowel obstruction and significant inflammation.     The surgery was complex due to previous surgeries. Dr. Greenstein and his team provided exceptional care and an exceptional outcome.   I can't say enough about their skill and bedside manner.	2
Excellent surgeon!  I highly recommend Dr. Greenstein to anyone looking for a surgeon.  I’ve had abdominal complications for a while and it was not until I saw Dr. Greenstein, who recommended surgery immediately (the next day), that I realized how serious my condition was.	2
Dr. Greenstein is an excellent surgeon.  He explained everything in great detail. The explanation included what he needed to do in addition to other options.  I highly recommend him especially if you have additional complications like adhesions & or infection.  His experience was vital to my family & I comfortably choosing him for my surgery. I am very thankful to him & his team!	2
Due to a stricture that was non responsive to steroids, surgery was needed. Dr Greenstein had performed a friends surgery which changed her life thus far. I immediately contacted him and within MINUTES he worked on my transfer from a NJ hospital to Sinai. From the second i entered into the hospital the staff and Dr. Greenstein were unbelievable. I kept asking my mom if this was a dream. I have never been treated so kind and put at such ease. His bedside manner is just as amazing as his skills. 	2
Dr. Greenstein did a fantastic job with my recent complicated bowel resection. It wasn’t an emergency procedure and he made sure he took the time to meet me the night before and explain everything that was about to happen. He and the team were extra attentive the entire length of my stay in the hospital and post-op. I would recommend Dr. Greenstein to friends and family in a second.	2
I felt comfortable with Dr. Greenstein immediately upon meeting him. I had a successful bowel resection and am recovering smoothly.  He is an excellent surgeon with a great bedside manner who explained everything clearly. His office staff and surgical team are awesome. I would go back to him if need be and recommend him without hesitation. 	2
Dr. Greenstein and his staff are incredible. I had to have emergency surgery recently which was a scary and difficult time for me. He, along with his all star team, made me feel comfortable, took the time to address my questions, was caring and did a great job. While my procedure was complicated and uncomfortable, I’m so happy I was in his capable hands. 	2
I would and have recommended Dr. Greenstein who I refer to as 'The Wizard' . After numerous surgeries I went to Dr Greenstein although it was an extremely difficult case, Dr Greenstein and his team were able to perform the surgery. Its been 7 months, And I am in the best condition and best shape that I've ever been. Thanks to Dr Greenstein , I don't need another colonoscopy for another 2 years. 	2
"My mother was diagnosed with Diverticulitis in Nov 2017.
She was a complicated case with many serious infections and complications.
With multiple surgeries Dr. Greenstein performed he was able to save her life and return her life back to normal.

My experiences with Dr. Greenstein and his staff is outstanding and 
He is exceptionally detailed oriented and courteous.
He pays attention to small details and always answers questions.

He is an exceptional and outstanding surgeon he cured my mother!"	2
When I was told my Crohn's had developed complications requiring surgery Dr. Greenstein was the first name mentioned. Dr. Greenstein came highly recommended through many doctors and friends and I knew I was in amazing hands on my first office visit. He was able to complete a very complicated surgery without there being any complications. I am so grateful that Dr. Greenstein has given me my life back and I no longer have to let Crohn's Disease dictate what I can or can't do. 	2
An excellent surgeon who performed complicated procedures on me that have returned me to a full and satisfying life. I would recommend Dr. Greenstein without hesitation. I can't thank him enough.	2
Dr. Greenstein is not only a top notch surgeon, but a wonderful human being. His caringness for his patients is conveyed through his excellent bedside manners and through the time and attention he provides to each patient. I recently had my gallbladder removed and couldn't have asked for a more seamless process. The staff he employs demonstrate the same caringness as they help you through the process as well. I would definitely recommend Dr. Greenstein to my family or friends if the need arose.	2
I don't have enough room here to fully express my gratitude towards Dr. Greenstein. I have never felt more confident and trusting of a doctor.  Upon our first conversation I knew I was in the right hands for my bowel resection.  He explained everything he was going to do and all of the potential outcomes.  The surgery was a complete success and I haven't felt this good in years.  His expertise, follow-up, bedside manner and compassion are only a handful of reasons why I would recommend him.	2
Dr. Greenstein is the man! He was my surgeon for a laproscopic subtotal colectomy/illesotomy creation, a j-pouch creation, and illestomy reversal. If not for him I would have an illesotomy for the rest of my life. He has a great team working under him and all of the resources of The Mt. Sinai Hospital supporting his surgical practice. 	2
Dr. Greenstein did my surgery in early November for my colon. He did an amazing job. His team is phenomenal and always checked up on me. He’s an amazing surgeon and I would recommend him remotely. 	2
"Dr. Greenstein preformed a lap partial colectomy for diverticulitis. The experience and outcome could not have been better. He has a very confident and caring demeanor about him. His thorough explanation of the surgery calibrated my expectations and put me at ease. In thanking him he said, ""Your case was very difficult but I enjoyed the challenge.” This is a doctor who is truly passionate about what he does, is not afraid to take on a challenge. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to anyone. "	2
I just had my 3rd bowel resection and Dr. Greenstein was my surgeon. I have to say compared to the previous 2 surgeries this one was by far the best experience! Dr. Greenstein came HIGHLY recommended to me from everyone in the G.I. department at Mt. Sinai. He is amazing! SUPER skilled in what he does and an extremely nice person to boot. I am SO GRATEFUL for having him take care of me. I really felt like he cared for my wellbeing and wanted me to have the best chance at a normal life. 100 stars!	2
Dr. Greenstein performed my surgery for ulcerative colitis in three parts over the span of 6 months last year. After over a year out of surgery, with no complications (knock on wood) I have gained 30 lbs in muscle and can finally stay awake and active through an entire day. I met with 6 surgeons going into surgery, including an 8 hour road trip to the Cleveland Clinic and no one made me feel as comfortable as he did. Theres not enough characters allowed here to explain how great this man is. 	2
I was referred to Dr Greenstein by my GI and could not have been in better hands. Surgery went as well as expected, he had great bed side manners.  	2
Dr Greenstein is a wonderful surgeon.  He was able to repair the damage another surgeon did to me.  He was very honest and did not promise anything until he was able to operate and see exactly what was done to me.  My post op experience was 100 percent different from my past surgeries (3).  Shows what a difference a excellent surgeon makes.  Do not hesitate to use him.  I am now whole and well.	2
Dr. Greenstein cured my severe ulcerative colitis that was unresponsive to all medication by preforming a 3-part J-Pouch surgery. He walked me through each stage and explained that he could help me to finally regain my health. I can't say enough about him and his staff. He was very professional and always quick to respond to any questions I had. He is an excellent surgeon and I am very thankful to have found him.	2
I am a physician. He operated on my son for Crohn's Disease complications. Excellent surgeon. Super nice guy and very responsive.	2
Dr. Greenstein is a true professional, very personable and he took the time to review my case and answer all my questions. His attitude put me at ease and took much of the fear out of the upcoming Appendectomy surgery. His staff, too, followed his professional and friendly example.The surgery team at the Hospital appeared very skilled, they came by, introduced themselves and described their role in the procedure. If you are in need of a professional and caring surgeon, Dr. Greenstein is it.	2
First class professional	2
Dr. Greenstein performed a three-step IPAA procedure, as I had severe ulcerative colitis that would not respond to any drug therapy. From the moment I met him, Dr. Greenstein put my mind at ease. He walked me through each step of the procedure, answered any questions I had (even responding to e-mails within a couple of hours), and assured me I would feel much better. Before and after each surgical procedure, Dr. Greenstein was always visible, caring, and supportive. I would highly recommend him!	2
I was scared and worried about my sudden complications with Chron's disease and Dr. Greenstein was the best thing to happen to me. He not only returned my call on a Sunday, he personally cared and guided me every step of the way. He is patient, kind, knowledgeable, and very with-it. I was kept informed about all my options and when a course of treatment was decided with his help I felt totally safe in his hands. His team is also professional and caring. I cannot praise Dr. Greenstein enough.	2
Dr. Greenstein is truly a skilled surgeon, he also is a very caring doctor.  He also has a nice bedside manner.  I was very scared of what was going to happen with my surgery, but he explained what was going to happen at each stage of my surgery, and reassured me along the way.   I feel Dr. Greenstein is truly a master in his field, and would recommend him for J pouch surgery.	2
This man is not only a highly skilled surgeon, he is brilliant and extremely compassionate.  He has a deep understanding of inflammatory bowel disease, and what we go through as patients.  He has essentially saved my life, through performing a difficult resection, as well as connecting me with highly skilled colleagues.  He is incredibly responsive - I can't say enough about Dr. Greenstein.  I have great respect for him and his father, and am grateful for his treatment of me	2
Dr. Greenstein is very professional and is extremely knowledgeable in his field. I would recommend him to anyone having surgery. He and his staff made the entire experience a pleasure. He answers all questions thoroughly and is very easy to understand. He is everything you want in a doctor and more. 	2
Dr. Cicilioni is the worse surgeon ever! Prior to my wife’s double mastectomy, this so called “doctor,” told us when he was finished she would have eye popping cleavage!  Well, she is totally disfigured and will never be the same woman again!  During the many visits to his office, him and his staff were unprofessional and totally incompetent!  At one point my wife was crying in his office and we walked out.  The job is incomplete and he has never called or checked up on my wife!  DON’T USE HIM!!	0
"Dr. Cicilioni performed my bilateral mastectomy in October of 2017 and reconstructive surgery in Jan 2018. 2 months after surgery my right implant flipped making my right breast flat. Dr. Cicilioni said the pocket was too large 
I had surgery to tighten the pocket in May.  2 months I am in the same situation implant flipped and Dr. Cicilioni will not continue to care for me because he's moving. He knew I agreed to follow him to Sarasota but now there is a problem and he can't help me any longer."	0
"Dr. Cicillioni is an awesome doctor!  
Excellent PR skills!
Very thorough in explaining your condition and the administration of your procedure(s)."	2
I'm a career OR nurse; Director of Surgical Services for 40 years. I worked in 700 bed trauma centers as well as small hospitals. I was diagnosed with basal cell cancer on the end of my nose. Getting enough tissue for a clean margin was critical. Peers recommended a board certified plastic surgeon, Dr Cicilioni. I drove 4 hours to see him and for surgery. He was meticulous, kind, caring, patient and skillful; the incision is amazing; his team is awesome! Couldn't recommend any higher! Kudos!!!!!	2
Do not go here!  Go anywhere else but here.  He does not know what he is doing.	0
"I recently had a double mastectomy due to breast cancer..after deciding to have reconstruction surgery I was very fortunate to find Dr. O. Cicilioni in Sarasota. He made a very unpleasant experience much more tolerable. He is very kind, compassionate and has a great personality and sense of humor.I have just completed my reconstruction and I feel Dr. C. did an excellant job..I highly recommend Dr. C and his staff was very friendly and helpful as well.
Thank you Doctor C...much appreciated."	2
"Dr C and his staff are wonderful! Tiffany and Liz are great. They have always been kind and accommodating to me and I would highly recommend 
Kim Bannister"	2
This doctor did not deliver the service promised during our consult. His staff was very unprofessional, and after I explained that to him he never extended an apology and neither did his staff. He did not do what he said he would do, and I waited an entire month before a call or email was returned. I had an important procedure that needed to be set up through his office. By the time I heard from them it was too late. I would not ever recommend this doctor:-( very disappointing...	0
Dr. Cicilioni performed a facelift and blepharoplsty recently for myself. He is an excellent plastic surgeon. I am very happy. He does wonderful natural facelifts, you look and feel younger, rested and relaxed naturally not over pulled. I highly recommend him.	2
He is very attentive and very professional ,I've been a patient for about 3 years now and I don't have any complaints about him or his staff.	2
I told him exactly what I wanted from my reconstruction and he would tell me that is not going to give me the results I was looking for, thinking that he knew best, i went with his recommendation twice and twice I am disappointed. I would not recommend him to anyone and I am just waiting until it is time to replace my implants to find a Dr that can fix what I am now stuck with for the next 3-8 yrs.  I wish I would have listened to my gut when i read previous reviews.	0
Dr. Noguchi seemed very passionate and personal. Very pleased with his professionalism. 	2
Dr. Bogucki saved my life. He is not only an excellent surgeon, but also a superb human being. A Doctor that heals you with his words before anything else. Thank , thank you for being there for me.	2
Outstanding!!	2
This man is an amazing surgeon and great doctor. He spends the time he needs to with his patients and makes bad situations much better.	2
There aren't enough words to describe how wonderful Dr. Chabot is! His professionalism, bedside manner, medical expertise, follow-up care, etc is all superior to any experience I've had in my life with a medical professional.  He has substantial experience in this specialty, has seen it all, knows what he's doing and after my partial pancreatectomy w/ spleen removal, was able to completely preserve my pancreas at full functionality.  I went to Dr. Chabot this summer for surgery to remove a very large cyst with malignant potential in a few years (no malignancy threat at time of removal or after review by pathology). He saved my life.  The team of professionals that Dr. Chabot works with are stellar individuals.  They're caring, compassionate, knowledgeable, the list goes on!  I and my family trust Dr. Chabot and his team with my life.  Thanks to his expertise, I'm now living my absolute best and healthiest life.	2
Dr Chabot performed the Wipple surgery on me 5 years ago & saved my life. Excellent surgeon and person	2
Dr. Chabot and his whole staff made my visit less stressful with their professionalism, knowledge and the time they took to make comfortable and informed.	2
Dr. Chabot and his entire team (shout out to Donald) are absolutely unbelievable. To be faced with such scary, uncertain circumstances they somehow manage to make you feel completely at ease. Dr. Chabot did an incredible job on my surgery and his follow up both in the hospital and after has been tremendously comforting and attentive. I truly trust that he is providing me with the highest level of treatment and care. 	2
Fabulous human being and surgeon.  My wife needed her gallbladder removed.  Dr. Chabot met with us and explained the procedure patiently.  He answered all of our questions.  He made us comfortable and confident.  The surgery went well and the follow-up office visit confirmed our very positive opinion about his professionalism.	2
I did extensive research and I came to Dr Chabot because of his outstanding reputation which was verified almost immediately. Dr Chabot demonstrated a level of care, concern and sensitivity which coupled with his widespread expertise makes him the medical professional par excellence. 	2
Supremely expert surgeon, who treated us with enormous empathy and kindness.  We knew we were in the best hands.	2
There are not enough superlatives to express my thanks, respect, and admiration for Dr. Chabot. He is the reason I am alive and well. And he has ALWAYS been warm, empathic, responsive, and direct. He is a very special doctor. 	2
I have highest confidence in dr chabot.  He is a great surgeon who left my pancreas fully functioning just after two weeks after surgery.  Unfortunately cancer was discovered in the tissue that was removed.  As a precaution I will receive chemo therapy.  I find dr chabot to be very thorough and his bed side manner very soothing.  	2
Dr. Shabo is an excellent doctor and has a great bedside manner. he and his staff do everything possible to make patients comfortable and make sure that they received the very best of Medical Care. I wholeheartedly endorse dr. Shabo as a professional and person and feel blessed to have been his patient.	2
Dr Chabot is a great clinician with a good bedside manner. He is one of the finest experts in his field and provides a comforting feeling in trusting he and his team’s expertise. 	2
"Awful!

Dr Chabot performed surgery removing partial tail of my pancreas some years ago. He explained the surgery: what he was removing and why. We agreed he was also removing my spleen. 

After operating, he told me he decided to do spleen-saving surgery to show his students how that was done.

He left me with hyperplasia at the margin.

Also, the pathologist misdiagnosed my type of tumor. (I had my slides sent to five pathologists at great hospitals, all of whom disagreed w/her)."	0
A true professional. Caring and compassionate. I have never met someone whos' whole heart and soul was so dedicated to what he does. 	2
Dr Unger takes the time to explain your situation in a manner that is understandable and he doesn't talk down to you  He treats you like you are capable of understanding whats going on, something I dislike IMMENSLEY in other doctors.	2
Professional, hospitable, extremely competent, trustworthy and patient.	2
Always a great experience with Dr. Steven Unger and the crew.	2
Dr. Unger and his staff are truly compassionate and patient-focused.  Communication is amazing, and Dr. Unger always finds a way to get back to his patients with any questions or concerns they might have.  You can tell that they truly care, which is refreshing given the state of medicine these days.  Highly recommend Dr. Unger.	2
Every one is very nice and professional also the doctor takes time to explain to you what is happening with you and if surgery is needed he explains why and what is going to happen 	2
Great experience, he is the consummate surgeon who is very detailed and to the point while taking the t ime to address your concerns.	2
I was very pleased with Dr. Unger's experience and knowledge.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone that requires surgery.	2
 The only concerned that we have was the waiting room was packed and our appointment was at 10 o’clock and we got into the back probably about 11… The receptionist at the front window offered us an explanation for the delay in seeing the physician,which was extremely appreciated and something that most doctor’s  offices don’t usually do.But other than that the doctor is extremely professional and patient; Dr Unger was not “rushed” with us.  The staff is very friendly and patient focused. 	2
"I have been a patient of Dr. Unger for over 10 years or more now.
I strongly recommend to anyone his expertise and care.
The girls at the office are very proffesional and very helpful.
B.R. Luis."	2
Dr Unger is the ultimate professional medical practictioner. He is knowledgeable and affable, never rushes through his consultations and always has his patient's best interests at top of mind.	2
Great experience.  Not rushed.   He took time to explain everything     Felt very comfortable	2
Four years ago I was operated on by Dr. Unger for two hernias and ever since I have been living in pain. I have since returned twice for remedy to my sufferance, and I am greeted with a shrug of the shoulder and a simple response that I must be of the unlucky 10% who are botched, though I was told there would be no ill consequences of the operation. As an active man and avid golfer, living in such pain is debilitating. You are better off consulting with your local butcher then Dr. Unger.	0
Dr. Smith recently saved my life, when my appendix ruptured and sceptis was spreading throughout my body.  On an emergency basis, God placed me in the hands of an extremely capable surgeon.  Post-op care was excellent—he really cares and listens to you.  He’s simply the best!	2
Dr. Smith was so caring and considerate of my mother's unique situation. He was very patient and thorough in his explication of the procedures she needed. He was a calming force to my family and not just professional but personable and kind. 	2
"Recently had thyroid cancer diagnosis and was referred to Dr. Prescott. I could not be more pleased with my
Experience from consult to surgery. Dr Prescott extremely compassionate, through and one of most talented doctors I have ever been seen by. His bedside manner put my mind at ease from the very beginning. He takes time
To explain things throughly and even Provided his personal cell phone number to call with any questions or concerns. My whole experience with Dr Prescott and Johns Hopkins hospital was top notch!"	2
Excellent surgeon, not only technically but has a wonderful bedside manner not always seen in surgeons. He is kind and compassionate and makes sure all of your questions are answered.	2
Dr Prescott Is very kind, very pleasant, explains everything, very responsive even gave me his personal cell phone number and responds immediately on any questions, overall a great and phenomenal surgeon and extraordinary gentlemen. I recently had my laparoscopic Adrenal surgery and everything went very smooth. He is one of finest. I’m so glad he and his team did my surgery.	2
Dr.Prescott is truly amazing ! He did surgery on my mom to remove her thyroid . When we met with him for her first appointment he explained everything very well and made sure we understood everything . He made my mom feel so comfortable. Her surgery went well and I am thankful to have had him as her doctor . Soooo amazing . Best surgeon .	2
Kind, compassionate, and a top-notch surgeon to boot. Very impressive. One of Hopkins' finest.	2
Very pleasant, thorough, and a delight to work with.  I was very satisfied with the entire process	2
Excellent doctor listens to the patients concerns and explains everything thoroughly.	2
"My experience has been outstanding. Ron has performed 2 surgeries on my face. This was first time I have ever had an issue with ""abnormal"" cells and stage zero. Ron was recommended by my body check Dermatologist. Her advise to me was ""if you want anything surgically removed on your face, there is only ONE doctor I'm referring you to and that doctor is Ron Shelton"". I concur with other reviewers that he has a warm and special bedside manner. But even more than that, he exudes confidence and calm during office visits which we know can be stressful.  I trusted Ron's opinion about which procedure would be best for ME and value his opinion going forward to achieve the best results to minimize scaring. He is a conservative doctor - his communication is clear and to the point and he is wonderful at managing expectations.  So far everything he said about my post ops has come true. I am proud to be included on his website ""Wall of Fame""."	2
Dr. Shelton and his staff are top notch. He has a great bedside manner and is a true expert at what he does. Who wants to have skin cancer? Nobody. But if the sun is not your friend and melanoma runs in your family and no matter how much sunblock you use you still need care, he is the best. I recommend him and his staff without reservation.	2
Excellent  Surgeon listens very well , great bedside manners	2
Dr. Shelton is gentle, compassionate and completely understanding of his patient.  In my 3 visits, which included two procedures, Dr. Shelton NEVER rushed and always took the time to answer all of my questions as well as explain as much as I wanted to hear about what he was doing.  In my 60+ years, he is only 1 of 2 physicians that has impressed me with these type of characteristics.  And, you get a skilled surgeon to boot.  I can't recommend him enough.  You will be totally at ease.	2
The very best in his field in my opinion.... great doctor great persona....can’t say enough about him 	2
Excellent surgeon and caring.  Personal attention and open to discussion and explanation.	2
As a clinician, Dr. Shelton is conservative and precise, guided by the necessary technology and mapping that reveals healthy vs malignant tissue. His explanations through all phases of surgery are clear and accurate. As an individual, he is intuitive, proactive, empathetic, and encouraging. His explanations throughout all phases of surgery are clear and realistic. While he shines on his own, he does as well as a team player, partnering with plastic surgery as needed to optimize patient outcomes.	2
I’ve been coming to Dr. Shelton for over ten years, staring with a minor lightening of a facial broken blood vessel but referred by a friend who’d had some pretty serious Moh’s done on his nose for skin cancer.  I wouldn’t trust anyone else in NYC with my face or skin in general.  He I s completely skillful, medically up to date and has probably the best judgment concerning aesthetic procedures that one can find. I feel sorry for people on the street who have obviously been treated elsewhere.	2
I came to Dr. Shelton for help with one specific skin problem.  Through treatment, the problem was made much more significant. 	0
"Dr. Ronald Shelton is a consummate professional who is dedicated to providing the highest quality of care to his patients.  He is very kind, compassionate, and responsive to all questions, He called me at home following surgery to ensure I was fine and not experiencing any pain.  Dr. Shelton is a brilliant surgeon with impeccable credentials.  He is meticulous, thorough, and has a wonderful sense of aesthetics.  I am thrilled with the outcome of my Mohs surgery!  I strongly recommend him.



. "	2
Dr. Shelton is very good at what he does. He educates his patients because he wants them to feel comfortable.  Unlike most doctors, he will actually spend the time with you to discuss treatment options rather than just handing over a brochure or pamphlet. 	2
I have been seeing Dr. Shelton for about 10 years and I would highly recommend him.    He stays up-to-date on the latest procedures and products, and answers any questions honestly - providing the pros and cons of any procedure. He wants his patients to look natural, so he will tell you when a particular product or procedure may not be a good choice.	2
I went to Dr. Ron Shelton today to have a Mohs procedure on a squamous cell carcinoma on my leg removed.  The whole experience from beginning to end was excellent.  Dr. Shelton took time to build rapport: he warmly introduced himself..  He explained the procedure clearly.  He was very skillful in the surgical procedure and was assisted by competent nurses who were also kind and personable.  I did not have a a minute of worry.  I would say that he is an extra-good doc and highly recommend him	2
I've seen Dr. Shelton numerous times in recent years to have something excised, and his work is superb, especially in repairing the site of the incision:  you can't make out a scar, even on my face.  Also he is an utterly personable fellow, with an easy, outgoing manner, and explains clearly and calmly what's going to happen.  Bonus:  all the the people who support his practice, from nurses to the front desk, are a pleasure to deal with, including making appointments.	2
"I am amending my previous review since Dr. Shelton deserves 5 stars not 4.
As I stated in my previous review, he is simply the best!!!
"	2
Dr Shelton performed Mohs surgery on my nose. The care I received from him and his staff was exceptional. He was very reassuring and spent time explaining the procedure to me. His staff was very professional and considerate on each of my visits. My post operative recovery was fine; in fact, there is no indication that I ever had any procedure done on my nose - a testimony to the doctor's skill. If I ever need any additional procedures done, I would only go back to Dr Shelton and his staff	2
Dr. Shelton is exceptional--a wonderful clinician who is as skillful as he is compassionate.	2
Excellent. The best dermatologist I've been to so far. 	2
Excellent cosmetic dermatologist.  He made feel so much better after the work he did.  He's tops in cosmetic dermatology in my opinion.	2
Dr. Anolik is the consummate professional. Furthermore, he is an artist. It is a blessing to be in his hands. 	2
Dr. Anolik is an excellent dermatologic surgeon.	2
"Dr. Anolik has a fantastic talent of enhancing your best self , without creating a fake or overdone look... he is punctual , personable , professional and pleasant to the eye!
I would almost not recommend him and keep him a secret!!... that’s how good he is :)"	2
Fantastic 	2
Great Physician out come is amazing!!!!!!	2

I see Doc, Haberman for 4 years already, very comfortable with him. He always gets to the point, listen to you and give the right cure. I highly recommend.	2
I have been to several other derms and none of them have cared as much as Dr. H does.  He took the time to figure out the best way to help clear my skin.	2
It's a pleasure to finally find a doctor that listens and cares	2
Welcoming and caring nurse and medical assistants!  Doctor diagnosed and addressed my health issues with a treatment plan.  Dr Haberman was available 24/7 and answered and/or returned all my calls promptly.	2

"I have been a patient of  Dr. Haberman since 2006, he has a great ""bedside manner"" and his expertise is second to none, have had 5 skin cancer surgeries (Moh's type) for basal cell, all with minimal  discomfort and scarring. Recommend his practice wholeheartedly!"	2
Great dermatologist. He did many aesthetic procedures on my face w/ great results. I referred all of my friends.	2
fixed my face	1
wonderful experience my full confidence	2
Doctor works miracles	2
Dr. Haberman is nothing less than amazing. I have seen dermatologists for years. He is the first doctor that has taken the time to listen to my concerns and diagnosis accordingly. He is an active listener and truly knows his practice. I have no reservations and recommended Dr. Haberman wholeheartedly to anyone who may be struggling with acne. He gave me hope that my skin can get better and it became excellent. I’m so happy!	2
Always quick and efficient and amazing results.	2
I've had 2 procedures done and received a diagnosis on a skin condition that I have not been able to eleviate, after seeing 2, very well know and respect doctors. I'm blown away by Dr. Haberman and his excellent staff! My confidence level is off the charts for Dr. Haberman, off the charts!!	2
Will never go to another doctor.	2
Dr Haberman help me with my problems 	2
Great doctor ! He has treated my rash when 3 other dermatologist could not! 	2
Assistant Katherine also excellent. 	2
In June of 2018 I developed a rash on my cheeks and chin. My G. P. recommended a local Dermatologist, 4 visits, 4 different diagnoses, 4 different antibiotics 4 different ointments and the condition was getting exponentially worse, tried another local Dermatologist, recommended by my G. P.,  another diagnosis, another prescription. Within 4 days the situation was horrible. I found Dr. Saluja on the internet. In just 1 week he accomplished what 2 others could not in 6 months. Dr Saluja is AMAZING	2
I don’t recomment him at all. We went to see him for some pink spots on skin and he just said it’s skin cancer and we need to do Nitrogen treatments to freeze it!!! Without any biopsy! We freaked out and we lived in a nightmare untill we saw another doctor who did a biopsy and it came out clean! I can’t believe a doctor would do such thing to a patient!! Horrible experience!	0
"Dr. Saluja is extremely well trained and conducts patient visits with kindness and thoroughness. Everything is explained in detail. 
I feel confident that anyone who chooses to see Dr. Saluja will be more than satisfied. "	2
Got appointment promptly. Office staff very friendly and efficient. Dr. Saluja was very thorough in his whole body examination and removed several moles which had grown rather ugly but were otherwise innocent. Very pleased with entire experience.  	2
Dr. Saluja was fantastic! He took his time with me and explained things so that I really understood my treatment options. I got botox and filler and barely felt anything! I was really impressed.  	2
Dr Saluja’s warm and friendly disposition, combined with his impressive technical abilities and base of knowledge make him stand or from any physician I have encountered. He took time to explain everything to me, answer all 5000 of my questions, and went above and beyond what I would have otherwise expected. I am so pleased with the outcome and will definitely be back— and will certainly be referring friends and family to him! 	2
"Dr. Saluja is an exceptional doctor, kind, thoughtful and extremely knowledgeable. I saw him for fillers to help with facial skin laxity due to aging.
He listens to your concerns and provides well thought out treatment.   He has a conservative approach and used fillers to give my skin a renewed lift so I
looked refreshed and younger.  I was very happy with the results and would
highly recommend him without reservation. 

"	2
I had the pleasure of being under Dr. Saluja's care. I found him to be very informative, personable and tolerant of my numerous questions.  I would highly recommend!!!	2
"Dr. Saluja is very caring and listened to what I wanted. I was unsure of the cosmetic products that were best for me but he was very patient and he guided me to the correct choice. I am so happy with my results! I had filler and the best part is that nobody knows that I had anything done, but everybody has been telling me how great I look and how youthful my skin is. 
"	2
"Dr. Saluga 
Beyond being highly trained and clearly skilled  Dr. Saluga has been gifted with a very good artistic eye as well as highly reliable judgement. He was able to assess my face and my goals and match them with precise facial treatments that left me looking entirely refreshed and softer, not artificial, actually even better than I could have imagined. He did a beautiful job! I wouldn’t hesitate to go back to him or recommend  him to friends and family. "	2
I sought out Dr. Saluja for some cosmetic treatments. I received botox, a wonderful laser treatment and filler. Dr. Saluja is a skilled, well trained, talented and kind physician. I am VERY happy with my results.  His follow up was outstanding! I look forward to continued treatments with Dr. Saluja. I would definitely recommend him to family and friends. 	2
"I recommend Dr. Saluja for excellent clinical care and follow up. 
Beverly"	2
Dr. Saluja addressed my concerns and used fillers to restore  lost volume in my face.   I am very pleased with the results.	2
I am very pleased with the treatments I received from Dr Saluja - I was hoping for improvements on fine lines and brown spots and he delivered! He made recommendations on the most appropriate treatments for me and answered all my questions ahead of time. He prepared me for the downtime after my procedure, was happy to help with my follow up questions along the way, and most importantly, now I love my results! I look forward to continuing with treatments and hopefully more improvement over time!	2
Words cannot express how satiSfied I am with all my results from Dr. Saluja's work on me!!, from my lips fillers ,fillers on my  cheeks (around mouth folds)everyone has complemented how great, young and looking refresh, thanks to Dr. Saluja wonderful job!! I feel like he took 10 years off me, he did it around my birthday and for sure it was the best bday gift ever!! I highly recommend him to anyone who wants a real clean,professional bruise free  and delicate job done! from 1 to 10 gets 10.5 	2
Dr. Saluja is the definition of fantastic dermatology. I cannot say enough good things about him. His level of care is amazing. He did my filler and I have never been disappointed. Not only is he extremely talented, but also listens to you as a patient. He is one of the most skilled cosmetic dermatologist I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. I cannot wait to see him again! 	2
Dr. Saluja is amazing! He helped my acne reduce and told me exactly how to make it better and how to prevent it. I'll definitely be sending my friends to him.	2
Being treated by Dr. Saluja was a wonderful experience - he is patient and explains treatment procedures thoroughly, and clearly has top notch medical ability and expertise - it's evident that he has trained with the top dermatologists. On top of that, his demeanor is kind and compassionate, and it's clear that he cares about providing the best care and connecting with his patients.  Would recommend Dr. Saluja to family and friends 10/10 times. 	2
I had Botox with Dr.Saluja and I have to say he has a gentle touch. I am very happy with the results! I would recommend Dr. Saluja to my family and friends.	2
I had a GA peel and laser hair removal with Dr. Saluja. He was very personable and friendly.  He answered all my questions and helped clear up some misinformation I had gotten about laser treatments and darker skin tones. I felt so much better informed after speaking with him. I look forward to continuing treatments now that I know what is available, possible and safe for me. 	2
"I received a Fraxel Dual treatment from Dr. Saluja.  He was excellent.  He has a nice bedside manner, very calming and took the time to explain everything about the procedure and what I should expect post treatment.
My recovery was just as he explained and I'm thrilled with my results.  My skin texture is great and my skin tone is much more even.  I lost a lot of my brown spots and redness.  I would highly recommend him."	2
Everything a doctor should be. He took his time with me, addressed all my concerns, and gave me a detailed treatment plan. It has been two weeks since I saw him and my skin is much, much improved! I cannot thank him enough. 	2
It's not easy to find a good, knowledgeable doctor that inspires trust. Well, Dr. Saluja, is one of the very few! Can say that I've been very pleased with the treatment results. Highly recommended!	2
Dr. Saluja is very nice and knowledgeable. I had a cosmetic procedure (botox) done with him and was happy with my results. I trust him with my skin and would recommend him to friends and family. 	2
Excellent service!	2
Dr Seidenberg helped me achieve a younger look in the most subtle way.  I appreciate his attention to detail and professionalism.  	2
I have been a client for about ten years.  Dr. Seidenberg provides a full body scan and located a tiny melanoma before it could spread.  He is terrific physician and I highly recommend him.	2
"This Doctor is amazing. Very personable and extremely erudite. I was running 45 minutes late in NYC traffic and the guy waited for me. Need I write more?

Michael Norinsberg"	2
He is both caring as well as knowledgeable.He takes the time to insert your needs and explains the issues with clarity.he is a rare Doctor, because he cares about his paients.	2
Best and funniest doc. Very thorough. 	2
I have a very exceptional experience during my visit with Dr. Seidenberg. He was patient, thorough, and listened to all my concerns and answered all my questions. The office staff was excellent, office was spotless, and I was in and out in under 30 minutes. Couldn't ask for much more.	2
I am very happy with my medical care from Roy Seidenberg MD. He is always caring, kind and always takes his time with me. 	2
Dr. Seidenberg is a caring and compassionate professional. He has done a masterful job at treating my numerous skin cancers.	2
I cannot fully say how happy I am in having Dr. Seidenberg as my dermatologist...everything about him and his staff is excellent!  His work is professional, friendly and most important, the highest quality!  I recommend him to all my friends!	2
"My husband and I have been long time (and oh so happy) patients of Dr. Seidenberg who is wise, warm and always able to relieve our anxiety.  His staff is kind and thoughtful and the entire office ambiance is welcoming.
"	2
Dr. Seidenberg is a genuine, wise, and attentive physician! I feel comfortable bringing up embarrassing skin concerns and he reassures me each visit with education, treatment plans, and advises me also when treatment is not necessary. I have seen a marked improvement in my concerns since I first visited him. I cheerfully recommend him to all for regular dermatology visits. 	2
Simply outstanding on all counts!	2
Dr. Seidenberg is an excellent diagnostician that makes me feel comfortable and confident in my treatment and follow-up care.  The entire team at this location is excellent in coordinating services.	2
Big fan of the doc. Been a client since 2014 and great service and expertise. I never feel awkward and feel free to ask any questions I want.  I recommend him. 	2
"Absolutely the best dermatologist I have had the privilege to call my doctor!  Dr. Seidenberg has terrific bedside manner, hilarious sense of humor, genuine care and concern for all you have to say, does not pressure you into using ""designer"" products that so many other dermatologists have often done, & gives you a variety of treatment options (as available).  

I have been his patient for over 5 years now and recommend Dr. Seidenberg to friends and family & will continue to do so!"	2
Dr. Seidenberg is very professional, knowledgeable and straight-forward. The office is very clean and the wait time is very minimal. The front staff was very friendly. Dr. Seidenberg has nice bedside manners and a dry sense of humor. I find his alternative suggestions and not wanting to shove products down your through a positive.  I referred my brother and my brother had an amazing experience as well. 	2
Dr. Seidenberg has amazing bedside manner, good humor, is extremely knowledgeable and very attentive.  I trust him with my biggest organ on my body, my skin, lol!!!! But seriously,  I plan to bring my teen and husband to see him very soon.  The staff is a plus, very friendly and professional.  Availability is great and wait time is minimal.  	2
"Dr. Seidenberg is amazing. Very helpful and informative and personable. He helped me when I felt all hope was lost.I am so grateful I was referred to him. I would give him 100 stars. 
His staff was just as amazing. "	2
Dr. Seidenberg is a very approachable, easy to speak with dermatologist.  He took my appointment at the last minute and was incredibly highly responsive with followup.	2
Absolutely amazing all around - great bedside manner!	2
Gentle demeanor and gentle with treatments that I was not looking forward to!	2
Great experience with Dr. Seidenberg. Always gives the attention and time and is willing to answer questions. Explains things in a patient and non condescending manner. Highly recommended. 	2
"Dr. Seidenberg has been my dermatologist for several years and I owe him a big thank you for his thoroughness. He has been diligent in checking me for skin cancers because of my history with that.
He has undoubtedly saved me from serious problems by detecting all kinds of skin cancers in early stages. Recently it was melanoma. Thanks to Dr. Seidenberg it was removed before spreading. Ye, I would recommend him highly.

He's also quite pleasant as a person.

"	2
I am a physician myself and if I had a lecture by Dr. Seidenberg, I would have at least taken a Dermatology rotation in medical school. I have seen him for three different issues as issues of the skin have been my problem since childhood. Upon each occasion I have left his office with knowledge of my concern ( complete with graphics) ,treatment and most importantly a plan of action for the next step.	1
Friendly, thorough and very professional.  I see Dr. Seidenberg twice a year for scans and removal of lesions.  He and the staff are excellent	2
If only every doctors visit could be this good.  I needed a dermatologist asap to deal with a painful abscess.  Scheduling was so easy, it actually caught me off guard the day before.  Am I in NYC?  Entire staff was warm and wait was only 10 minutes.  Dr. Seidenberg is professional, knowledgable and has winning bedside manner.  He answered my 20 questions without exasperation and the treatment was A+.  He even called me end of the day to check on my condition...not a nurse. Him.  A first.  	2
Fantastic! Very friendly and knowledgeable. Have been coming to him for years. Wouldn't go anywhere else! 	2
excellent doctor, highly reccomended	2
Dr. Seidenberg is a very professional and knowledgeable doctor, who is also great at getting to know his patients and making them feel comfortable.  I have been going to him for several years, as has my Milliennial daughter.  His appointments have the kind feel of visiting an old-fashioned family doctor, who is able to help his patients better because he has actually taken the time to get to know them. 	2
Dr. Seidenberg and his staff were wonderful!  On time appointment, friendly and professional.  This was my first skin cancer screening and he made me feel very at ease.	2
Best dermatologist out there! Gives you exactly what you need and is extremely informative about how acne/blackheads are formed etc. Very friendly and great sense of humor as well! 	2
"I have been a patient of Dr. Seidenberg's for over 8 years and was most recently treated for a skin condition requiring a biopsy. He explained and answered all of my questions regarding my condition and treatment all the while keeping me calm and comfortable during the procedure. His nursing staff is just as thorough. I got a personal phone call from Dr. Seidenberg following up with my results and he made time to answer my additional questions.
"	2
My visit with Dr. Seidenberg was such a pleasant experience. He made me feel very comfortable immediately upon the beginning of the appointment, and took time to thorough explain my condition and answer any questions in full detail. Would 100% recommend my family and friends to schedule an appt. with him!	2
My experience with Dr. Seidenberg was excellent. This was my first time getting a cosmetic procedure, and I was nervous and slightly afraid of needles. He is a great listener, has a light touch and a wonderful bedside manner. I was very happy to visit his offices and will go back again for this and possibly other procedures. Many thanks!	2
"I came to see Dr. Seidenberg with high expectations, but left pretty disappointed.  The very first thing Dr. Seidenberg asked when I saw him was why I had to reschedule our appointment.  I told him it was because of work deadlines.  He said, ""oh, that's interesting"" and then insinuated that my work wasn't very important.  His inspection of my skin issue took one second, and his explanation sounded lazy.  He gives me the impression of someone who cares about his bottom line over his patients."	2
I had a skin problem that was going on for a while I kept seeing different doctors and no one managed to clear it up. When I came to dr seidenberg he knew exactly what kind of treatment I needed and within a week it was all gone. He also went beyond and addressed other issues .  I highly recommend him and am very thankful to his expert treatment . 	2
Dr Seidenberg diagnosed and extremely rare skin rash I had all over my body for 6 months.No one could tell me what it was or how to treat it. With one round of antibiotics, it quickly went away. He also removed 2 moles from my face and body painlessly and with no scaring. After being away for two years, he remembered my Dad was battling cancer and asked about how he was doing. He also found a dermatologist to recommend in my new city in case the rash came back.I was highly impressed w/ his skill	2
Dr Henry is very pleasant easy to talk to and kind. She has addressed every issue that I came to her with. Very happy with how my skin looks. 	2
Dr. Henry is great! She’s always professional and her pleasant manner always makes me feel comfortable during my visit. My last appointment in which I had to have a small cyst removed was seamless. I would recommend Dr. Henry without hesitation, you’ll be satisfied. 	2
Kind, thorough, and incredibly knowledgeable. 	2
Excellent service. Dr.Henry puts you at ease by explaining things in a calm matter. She was very personable. Did not try to push procedures or products which I found refreshing. 	2
Excellent!! Dr. Henry is a sweetheart! Warm, friendly, caring! Listens to all your concerns and questions! She is the best. I would definitely recommend anyone with skin issues to see her. You wont be disappointed.	2
An excellent doctor! She really knows her stuff, is extremely kind and cleared my acne up no problem!	2
MOHS surgery on my face	1
"If I could give Dr. Geronemus 10 stars, I would. A brilliant doctor who helps every patient look and feel their best. Dr. Geronemus is truly THE expert of the field.

 I could not praise Dr. Geronemus more highly. He is brilliant, caring, accommodating and quite frankly- a miracle worker!"	2

Excellent in all ways. His medical expertise + superb office staff. Everything about my experiences with his office are great. 	2
Dr. Geronemus is great. We completely trust him and has done a great job on my daughter's large facial hemangioma. His staff is amazing and we love them. 	2
I don’t have the words to express my gratitude to Dr. Geronemus and his incredibly professional staff. Every step of my tattoo removal process has been discussed, done swiftly and smoothly. His calm and soothing demeanor immediately puts you at ease and every concern is addressed. Just nothing but the up most professionalism and just a generous, terrific and caring doctor. The absolute best and I will always be indebted to the amazing work he’s done on me. Thank you Doctor you are just the best!	2
Excellent in every way.  Knowledgeable and highly skilled dermatologist.  Results have always exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommended!	2
"Dr Geronemus is GREAT!! I have a port wine stain on my face. It was visible even after covering it with a lot of concealer. I used to get So self conscious because people would always tell me that i have 
something on my face not realizing it was my birth mark. I started seeing results right after the first treatment and five treatments later my birth mark is barley visible. I can not thank Dr Geronemus enough. He is The Best!! And I highly recommend him! "	2
DR GERONEMUS IS A GIFTED ARTIST AND TRUE PROFESSIONAL.  HE HAS A VERY CALM AND SOOTHING DEMEANOR AND IS VERY KIND AND GENTLE.  HIS WORK IS EXCELLENT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM TO EVERYONE!	2
Our daughter began seeing Dr. Geronemus at 6 months old for the port wine stain she had on her cheek. Over the course of over a dozen treatments, the blemish is now almost completely removed and wholly invisible. Really fantastic outcome, which we are tremendously grateful for.	2
Had a Fraxel Procedure to help rejuvenate the skin on my face and neck.  The results are amazing and truly noticeable.  I felt safe in very experienced hands and the procedure was performed by Dr. Geronemus himself	2
dr Geronemus has done a great job on my skin and my daughter's with some of his lasers and injections. He is kind and attentive. The office is state of the art and very efficient.	2
I visited to Dr. Geronemus various times and my conclusion is that he is not only expensive but it seems his heart is no longer interested in his practice. Will not be going to him again.	0
I had the most wonderful experience this week with Dr. Geronemus and his staff.  This was the first time I had MOHS surgery and Dr. Geronemus was kind, gentle, reassuring and with his expertise took care of my problem immediately.  I have every confidence in his work.  The staff was considerate, courteous and made me feel comfortable.  They were helpful with follow-up and called to check on me the next day.  I was treated with respect and kindness and know without a doubt I had excellent care.	2
Dr. Papantoniou is incredible. There is no other doctor  I have ever encountered who is so kind to everyone. She puts you at ease and never, ever pushes a treatment, she works with her patients and you both determine what is best at this stage of your life. Dr. Papantoniou is a highly skilled and competent physician with tremendous empathy and patience. I absolutely refuse to see another dermatologist, Dr. Papantoniou is the absolute best.	2
"Let me first say that Dr. Papantoniou is one of a kind. I have never met a doctor that is so down to earth and extremely knowledgeable in all areas of medical and cosmetic dermatology. Dr. P’s office is state of the art in every possible aspect. It is warm and inviting exactly how she is.  Dr. P is the most ethical doctor I have ever met and that is why I trust her to do all my cosmetic procedures.  Dr. P is truly an artist.  She has taken my aging face and improved upon it in such a natural way that I’m just a better version of myself. I highly recommend Dr. Papantoniou to anyone
seeking expertise in the field of medical and cosmetic dermatology.  She is the Best!!!!! "	2
I am 65 years old and I had a large old age spot on my forehead. During this past year this spot started to develop into a crusty bump, which alarmed me.  I also have had my share of sunburns, during my lifetime.  I have never had a body scan for melanoma. My daughter, who is a patient of Dr. Papantoniou, pleaded with me to get checked out, so I made an appointment with her. She looked at my spot, told me it was not cancerous, then proceeded to remove it, painlessly. The area healed beautifully and you would never know that there was an old age spot there. She also found a suspicious spot on another part of my body and took a biopsy. Thank God the results came back negative. Knowing that melanoma can be a death sentence, it was foolish of me not to get checked out sooner. This exam gave me peace of mind. I was extremely impressed with her professionalism and expertise, as well as with her staff (Gail was extremely helpful). I will schedule follow up appointments with her in the future.	2
What can I say? You want to see the nicest doctor with the best bedside manor who knows what shes talking about? Then Dr. P is your lady. Friendly, funny, nice, CARING and above all you can tell she knows what shes talking about. 100% trustworthy. Beautiful office. Love her receptionist Gail too, super sweet lady. Wait is never long. Certainly never rushes you either. Not an office where they book quadruple appointments and keep you waiting for an eternity. I love feeling like I am home when I am there for a visit. I recommend her to any friend that says they need a dermatologist, hands down!! THE BEST!	2
Dr Papantoniou Is an amazing doctor and person.. she takes her time with every patient to make sure they get everything they need..  She treats you like a friend and greets you like that every time you come into her office.  Dr. Papantoniou knows all her patients by name.. it shows how much she really cares for her patients. She  Is very knowledgeable..  Dr. Papantoniou is one of a kind ?? I highly recommend her to everyone I talk too.. 	2
"
Simply Dermatology is SIMPLY THE BEST! As is of course the compassionate Dr. Papantoniou! From the minute you walk in to the office you are greeted from the staff with the utmost  professionalism and care! The office has the latest technology and is immaculate and warm!  Do not trust anyone with your skin but SIMPLY DERMATOLOGY!"	2
Dr. Papantoniou, she is an excellent Dr. very dedicated. You can trust her 100%.	2
Truly amazing doctor ! Results are life changing - spotless new office- state of the art equipment and resources!! Can’t wait to go back ????	2
I have been a patient of Dr. P for many years now and am always impressed by her knowledge, kindness, compassion, and great sense of humor.  She has always throughly explained my condition(s) while earnestly fielding my questions and giving me the time that I needed and more.  Her suggestions for treatment have been exceptional.   I highly recommend her.  ~Thomas	2
"I thought I was going to the Best Doctor Until My Friend Told Me To See Dr. Papantoniou.  I can't tell you there is  a difference in attitude, bedside manner, and skills. She not only took care of my medical condition within a few weeks of her treatment and advice, but i also had Dr. P do filler and botox, and my gosh,  is this woman an artist!  I hate to sound modest ;) but I look great!  No one looks at me and tells me ""oh did you do work to your face"" - they just tell me that i look great! "	2
I have been seeing Dr. Papantoniou now for a couple of years.  I followed her to her new practice in Melville.  Her new office is beautiful and immaculate.  I can't say enough postives about it and the location is easily accessible from major parkways.  Dr. Papantoniou is patient, and spot on with her recommendations and treatments.  Not pushy and takes her time with your treatment.  She has done several cosmetic procedures on me and I always look natural and refreshed.  She's great!!	2
Dr. Papantoniou is AMAZING! She knows what she is doing and is really great at it. I refuse to go to any other dermatologist but her. She is very caring and makes you feel comfortable. She is one of my favorite doctor. 	2
Patient and knowledgeable, lets you know every step of the way what will happen! ! Would highly recommend! I found my new dermatologist!	2
I am 55 yrs young and have been to many doctors over the course of my years. I move on to new doctors, leaving the old ones behind for a variety of reasons; rudeness, wait time, front office staff nastiness, bedside manner, listening ability, retirement, etc.  WELL THIS IS ONE DOCTOR I WOULD FOLLOW TO ANOTHER STATE!!!!!! Dr. Papantoniou is the single best doctor I have ever had the pleasure to meet. Polite, caring, trusting, listens, hears, remembers and never rushes. Office Staff are wonderful!	2
The Best of the Best.  I finally found a great dermatologist! After thorough research online and reading all of her reviews from all different sites, i finally made an appointment with Dr. Papantoniou.  Her office is very convenient and is super nice and clean.   She was very thoughtful with her cosmetic consultation. She took her time and seemed to analyze how should would treat me.  I was so impressed when i left, but even more impressed when I woke up the next morning and looked in the mirror	2
"I had searched hi and low to find a dermatologist of Dr. P's caliber.  She is my safe place. My family history of skin cancer is no longer a worry. Dr. P is thorough and my exams leave me worry free. Being over 21 (smile) I am interested in slowing down the clock. Never before have I had pain free Botox! Not even a pinch. Going forward I plan on doing full face Fraxel laser.
Past treatments include laser removal of a vascular birthmark on my forehead. Dr. P. is The Best! "	2
Dr. Papantoniou is a wonderful and caring Dr. She will take the time with you to explain your best options and treatments to go forward with. She is friendly and soft spoken. I highly recommend her as I have been going to her for 2 years now. 	2
"After rave reviews from my mom and sister, I decided to visit Dr. Papantoniou to have my moles checked.   Glad I did because lab results showed that one needed to be excised even further.  Also, I never had botox/fillers before and had many questions which Dr. Papantoniou patiently answered.  I decided to get some cosmetic work to ""refresh"" my look.  The results are subtle, but with continued use, I am hoping to see even more benefits.  I can not say enough great things about her...a true gem!"	2
If I could give 10 stars I would. Amazing is an understatement . I've recommended her to a few friends who also are patients of hers now too. Dr. Popantionau is the best!	2
"Sure, I'd be happy to. 

Great dermatologist.  I spend a lot of time to find a Dermatologist who inspires confidence and security. I found the right person. Im 52 years old, going for botox and brown spot treatments, with great results. I look like 42 and my face looks natural, nobody noticed my procedures. Dr Papantoniou
Is the best . She and her staff are very courteous and helpful.  She always have time for questions and answers.  Highly recommended "	2
My experience with Dr. Papantoniou was nothing but amazing.  She was so helpful, and knowledgeable with an amazing disposition.  The nagging issue that I had for almost a year was cleared up within a week.  She spent a lot of time with me ,making sure I understood in layman's terms what I was experiencing and why and how it could be cleared right up with the proper medication.  I highly recommend Dr. P!	2
Dr. Papantoniou resolved a problem that had been plaguing me for years.  Two dermatologists before her had failed to do so.  The first had no idea what to do and just experimented with various treatments until I refused one where the risks outweighed the potential reward.  The second dermatologist said that nothing could be done.  But Dr. Papantoniou's first idea solved the problem in just a few treatments,  Dr. Papantoniou is a skilled, friendly, caring and attentive physician!	2
I give Dr. Papantoniou 5 stars!  She is caring, friendly and knowledgable.  I would most definitely recommend her to others.  In fact, I already have!  Love her!	2
What a wonderful dermatologist.  I initially went to Dr. Papantoniou for general skin issues years ago.  I am in my early fifties and was in need of some cosmetic touch up work, although i did not know what to do.  Dr. Papantoniou walked me through her approach to facial rejuvenation and took her advice.  I could not be more happy with my results. What a difference this doctor could make.  	2
"Dr. ""P"" as I like to call her is such a warm and informative doctor. She has always been very attentive to my concerns and eases my fears. The wait time can sometimes be long, but she makes up for it with complete attentiveness, tips and advice. Both my children ( teens ) are now patients of hers and they are very happy with her. I would highly recommend her. "	2
Doctor Papantoniou is excellent ! So personable and down to earth, and very professional ! She made me feel so comfortable, like I wasn't bothering her (like I have felt with many other doctors). She also saw my daughter for her rosacea. Gave her some excellent remedies and lifestyle changes and it worked! Cleared up her skin. I would absolutely recommend her !	2
Dr.  Papantoniou is amazing! She is caring, smart and a great listener. She has treated me for an abnormal growth and was fantastic. I wouldn't go anywhere else!	2
Dr. Pap is the best doctor I've ever gone to. Yes, you'll more than likely have to wait a couple weeks before seeing her when you set an appointment, but that's because she's the best! She's busy,but worth the wait!I've gone to multiple drs in the past w/ no results,so my 1st visit I was crying over my painful,cystic acne that I've dealt w/for a decade.Dr P was very empathetic,& knew exactly what would help.The next visit I was crying tears of joy&relief. She's knowledgeable, respectful,&SO kind	2
I am a new patient and didn't even make a visit to Advanced D. Yet.  I have called several times trying to find out if my referral came through to your office and no one was able to help me.  I kept on being placed on hold each time I called (today and 3 weeks ago) and have already wasted 20 minutes of my time calling again and being placed on hold, and still not being able to have an answer from anyone in the office.  This is very disappointing.	0
Very friendly, humble, and experienced doctor! I recommended to my friends and they were also satisfied with her services 	2
Have been seeing a doctor Papantoniou for a while now. All my kids have been going to her too. Very kind. Carrying. And really good doctor from the heart. Someone you can trust and worth of waiting ????	2
"Ok. Here's the deal: she listens, she cares, she understands, and she's the best. The only issue I ever had was spelling her last name. I'm surprised in regards to the ""long waits"" people mention, yea some times you gotta wait a bit, but that's EVERY DOCTOR'S OFFICE!!! You're dealing with Guaranteed Quality Care here; so shut up and wait a second or two. I'm happy to call her my doctor and I would honestly recommend booking an appt with her asap. #demand"	2
"Dr. Papatoniou is an Excellent Doctor. She is smart, direct, precise, caring and to the point type of person- I Love that about her.  I am grateful to have met her- my family is grateful to have met her. 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"	2
Dr. P is the kindest doctor. She takes time to listen to your concerns and you never feel rushed. She is very knowledgeable and you feel comfortable that your in goood hands. I also feel like she's looking out for my best interest and not just trying to sell me services or products. Expert physician!	2
"I had a appointment with Dr. Papantoniou today I have been using her 3 years
She is caring thorough outstanding she listens cares and always makes you feel comfortable
Answers questions with her unsurpassed knowledge
I recommend her to everyone and you you will love her as I do.
There in no better Doctor than her"	2
Dr. Papantoniou was recommended to me by my PA and I was very happy with the recommendation. The wait was ridiculous, but the doctor and the staff were all very friendly and sensitive to my needs. 	2
Dr Papantoniou is caring, compassionate and thorough. I've been a patient for a year now, and she has addressed every skin concern from basic to unusual with the same compassion. She answers any question with her unsurpassed knowledge and expertise. I always feel comfortable and leave the office feeling confident with my diagnosis and treatment. The staff is also friendly and accommodating, especially with my hectic work schedule. 	2
Dr. Papantoniou is an outstanding, compassionate doctor.  I saw her for the first time a few weeks ago after suffering for years with a very itchy raw skin condition that my previous dermatologist could not get rid of.  Within a few minutes of seeing & identifying what was wrong with me, she took care of the problem.  By late in the day I was no longer itchy and raw and my condition is almost completely disappeared!  I am so grateful for her expertise and I look and feel so much better! 	2
I am so glad I found this doctor! She is very attentive and spends time to explain each procedure and dispel all of my concerns. I recently had Botox and fillers for the bags under my eyes and brow line. I can't believe the improvement I see in my face! I feel 10 years younger and no longer wake up with bagging eyes! I was always worried about looking to plastic but this doctor has a gentle touch and has made me feel naturally refreshed!  	2
Dr. Papantoniou is a great doctor. She gives you this sense of hope. I suffered from acne a lot and I felt it would stay there forever because it was so severe. When I went in to meet Dr. Papantoniou she gave me treatment that helped heal me so much. Not only did she make me better physically but she also talked to me assuring me that I will get better. She made me feel comfortable and gave me hope. Her treatment went so well with my skin. Going to her changed my life and it will for you too.	2
The Commack office is an absolute joke. First, The receptionist took 25 minutes to schedule appt. I was VERY clear about wanting to see Dr. Papantoniou.When we arrived, we were told Dr. P is not in the office on Mondays. Never apologized. Very poor attitude. Had to walk out.	0
Dr. Papantoniou is an exceptional and dependable dermatologist. I had a sudden breakout on my neck last year and it got quite painful by the time I visited her. However, she did not push me to try anything I was not willing to try. After deciding to go on Accutane, I was able to stick through the whole cycle because of her professionalism and confidence that it will work. When one side effect became a bit unmanageable she immediately made adjustments. Today, I am thrilled with the results. 	2
I found Dr P on healthgrades. I thought I was going to be disappointed. Aside from the long wait it was a great experience!  Dr P was very thorough and very sweet and so was her medical assistant! Hooray I finally found myself an awesome dermatologist!	2
She is an awesome Dr, I have been a patient for around two years now. She i personable, kind, and an smart . my fave Dr there!!	2
Dr Papantoniou is Excellent.I  went to her for a refreshed face and left 10 years younger and not 1 bruise!I never experienced a Dr.that was as sweet ,compassionate and skilled as her!Her nurse Claire complimented her and the two were just simply amazing.If your looking for someone that is great and trustworthy for cosmetic enhancing look no further!!Great experience!	2
"I love Dr. PAPANTONIOU. 
My son had a rash she quickly diagnosed him an the rash was gone after 5 days.  I have gone to Dr Papantoniou more for the cosmetic side. She has my skin shine..
I get so many compliments Thank you so much"	2
Saw her for the first time this week (fraxel laser). Will be back to see her again in the future. She takes her time speaking with you and makes you feel very comfortable. She even called the next day ( a Saturday) to see how I was doing and if I had any questions. 	2
Amazing Dr! Do not hesitate to see her. I had an emergency and was in pain and she saw me right away. I'm really not good with doctors and she made me feel at ease and I left pain free! I cannot say enough good things about her.	0
This review is overdue. Dr Papantoniou has been so amazing for my whole family. She is very thoughtful in her checkups and her advice (i have seen other dermatologists that have spent 2 minutes in the room with me).  She is an expert in removing acne scarring - absolutely exceptional.  She is always amazing with my children and my children are never scared when i mention we are going to see Dr Papantoniou. If your children have acne or acne scarring, please don't wait, go see her. 	2
I had a great experience with Doctor Papantoniou.  She made me feel very confident in her skills in handling me and the equipment she was using for skin tightening.  Her assistant was very friendly as well.  	2
Great office location, great doctor, and wonderful staff.	2

My daughter is terrified of doctors and she was actually not afraid of Dr Geffner. I am still in shock. Great location.	0
The staff is great with my father and they are truely amazing.	2
All of my questions were answered and I am leaving without the growth I had when I came in.	1
Dr Geffner and his team are awesome. They go above and beyond and spend the time with each patient, that they deserve. There may be a wait, but a professionalism and caring staff, make all the difference.	2
The day was long and I had to be there for the majority of it. The communication was great, I was able to get my procedure done and handle errands while I waited for me results. Dr Geffner and his staff are wonderful.	2
Dr Geffner and his staff are wonderful, caring, and professional.	2
I am very happy that I no longer have a growth and I can walk around with more confidence.	2
I am very happy with the way my surgery went and how wonderful the doctor and all of his staff was.	2
Highly impressed with how my appointment was handled and now I am feeling way better.	2
The care and professionalism here, is 100% the best!	2
I liked that I was called in and did not have to sit around and wait in the office for long periods of time.	2
Absolutely best of the best.	2
Amazing physician!  Came highly recommended and has exceeded my expectations. Have been his patient for several years and would highly recommend him!	2
Dr. Bernstein has been my dermatologist for many years. He I caring, competent and I would recommend him very highly...and I have.	2
Tops. Personable as well. Lived up to everything I had heard about him. 	2
"He is an amazing professional very knowledgeable and with excellent rapport 
I’m very impressed by his efficiency the "	2
My husband and I have been a patient for over five years since living in New Jersey He has always show patience and has always addressed our concerns giving adequate office time We respect his expertise and reccomendatiins Dale and Gary Muken	2
?? Great experience!!	2
"Dr Bernstein,
Has a bedside manner that is over the top. He always put one at ease, while preforming procedures in great examining rooms . His staff is top of the line as well"	2
Dr. Bernstein did Moh's surgery for a basal cell on my forehead. He was very kind, and the nurses on his staff were so amazing. They explained everything at every stage, and I felt very well cared for. Some waiting is necessary due to the nature of the procedure, but everyone kept me updated throughout the process.	2
Dr. Bernstein is patient, explains things in a way that the average person can understand, gives you options for the proper treatment for your condition and has a very kind caring way that makes you feel comfortable and confident in the practice...	2
Very fine physician, excellent manner, relaxed, caring, professional. Highly recommend. 	2
Great personality and of course good at what he does. Takes the time to explain and answer any questions you may have. Good on follow up too. 	2
Dr. Bernstein performed massive MOHS surgery, greatly exceeding the referring doctor's instructions His over-aggressive action resulted in the need for very large and difficult plastic surgery. He never mentioned the possible necessity of such surgery and completely failed to inform me with regard to possible alternative action. In addition, after having removed a major portion of my nose, Dr. Bernstein simply referred me to the plastic surgeon and never once ever inquired about my well-being.	0
total professional, excellent surgeon. Absolutely nothing negative to report.	2
Dr. Glick is top notch.  Super smart and thorough.  She also has excellent communication skills to make sure you understand in a clear and complete manner.	2
Dr. Glick is amazing!!!!  She is extremely thorough, professional and kind.  My 4 year old son had a skin condition that was being treated at a different practice for over a year with no improvement.  Dr. Glick helped resolve the issue within a month.  I am so grateful to her and cannot recommend her highly enough!	2
After only one appointment Dr Glick improved not only my acne but also the overall texture of my skin. She didn't stop there either. She's determined to continue improving my skin. She's nice, professional and passionate about what she does. Also, their office and staff are very nice and organized. I've never waited even 5 minutes for my appointment. They offer Capsule for prescriptions which has been extremely time saving for me. 	2
Dr Glick is a great doctor. Diagnosed my skin problem correctly at the first visit. Prescribed the right medication. Definitely would recommend her to all my friends and family	2
Dr. Glick is wonderful. I recently underwent a laser resurfacing procedure with Dr. Glick. She informed me the downtime would be long and she was supportive and available throughout the process. My skin looks amazing now and I could not have asked for better results! I am very grateful to her. 	2
Dr. Glick is amazing. She makes each visit so comfortable. She listens and answers all my questions. It’s very hard to find a doctor who is both thorough and professional and warm and nice. Highly recommend!	2
I have been seeing Dr Glick for about 2 years now and am always impressed by her level of care. She puts me at ease as soon as I see here and for medical appointments she is always super thorough and explains treatment and diagnosis clearly. For cosmetic procedures I trust her fully with my face and value her opinion and honesty - she never tries to sell me service unecessarily and I am always thrilled with the end result.	2
"DR GLICK IS A BLESSING??
I am on vacation and came down with a rash ... Guess my skin could not take the Sunny Beautiful weather.
She took the time to return my phone call and asked questions to figure out how this rash came about.
I followed her suggestions and 1 day later I am feeling 100% Better??

THANK YOU THANK YOU DR GLICK
I WILL BE WITH YOU FOR LIFE????"	2
She is as good as doctors come. I'm a physician, and I send every single patient who has cosmetic or medical dermatology concerns to her. She does my injectables and is extremely skilled and reliable. 10 stars for Dr. Glick.	2
I went to see Dr. Glick for wrinkles and lines I had on my face that I wanted to get rid of. Dr. Glick helped me understand my options and why certain treatments made more sense than others for my specific facial features. She explained the science behind different cosmetic procedures and helped me feel confident in my decisions. After her treatment, I look so great and got the exact results I was looking for! Thank you Dr. Glick! 	2
Ive been to a few dermatologists in the NYC. Dr Glick gave meticulous care to the scar I had from an unfortunate trauma. It was a huge relief I found a doctor that was on top of it since a scar could be permanent. Id recommend Dr Glick to any of my friends and family. Very grateful for her care	2
Dr. Glick has a remarkable work ethic and she made me feel comfortable through each of my visits. There have been absolutely no complications regarding the appointment, scheduling, nor with the procedures. I am pleased to come to this office, Dr. Glick and her assistant, Nicole, are truly great at their jobs!	2
I have long struggled with my acne and tried many different over the counter regimens, complicated routines, and products that don't work. Dr. Glick helped me simplify my routine and gave me a regimen that has completely changed my skin for the better. 	2
I saw Dr. Glick for non-healing lesion on my left arm. I have a history of skin cancer. Dr.Glick thought it might be a squmous cell and biopsyied it.  She also saw pink spots on my face which were precancerous and treated them with liquid nitrogen. IT WAS PAINLESS!! Biopsy came back as precancer totally removed. I don't usually go to Doctors but this doctor treats you with respect and kindness.	2
Dr Glick is a true gem and goes above and beyond.  She takes the time to listen, she reads about your history before you come back in so she knows what she is dealing with, she is up on latest information and treatments for all sorts of issues, and she is thorough and thoughtful. Her treatments work! Not only wonderful Dr for adults but also for teens.  Boys and girls.  She just has a great no nonsense manner and gets the job done, but she is warm and caring at the same time. 10 out of 10!	2
Excellent Dr, I first saw Dr. Glick when she was at another practice. I was so impressed with her that when she changed offices I made the switch as well. She is thorough and very professional. I highly recommend her. 	2
Dr. Glick is fantastic. Every time I see her she is efficient, thorough, and has always has answers to my questions and ideas about how to fix my problems. I love how solutions-oriented she is. Would recommend to any friend or family member! Plus, her offices are beautiful and clean, her staff is exceptional, and she is always running on time.	2
"Have had an amazing experience with Dr. Glick - she is extremely knowledgable and has provided me with the best treatment for my skin condition. She provided a treatment plan for my skin which felt like it was customized for me, unlike many other dermatologists whom I've seen - which was a game changer for my skin! Phenomenal at answering all questions and concerns, and great bedside manner - makes you feel comfortable! Wish there were more than five stars - she far exceeds ""Excellent""!"	2
My office visit with Dr. Glick was very informative. She takes her time and explain step by step about my skin care regiment and how to prevent future skin damage. I would recommend her to everyone that I know. Most dermatologist that I have seen in the past will see me for a brief moment and I would  feel rushed, but I'm happy that I found a doctor that cares about my skin issues and will go above and beyond to maker sure that I'm on the right regiment. Thank you Dr. Glick for your patience. 	2
Dr. Glick was very thorough and informative as well as warm and friendly. She laid everything out in a way I could understand and let me know what to stay away from to prevent skin damage. She made sure I was okay with the decisions she made and valued any input I had. I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family.	2
Great bed side manner and extremely thorough. I wouldn’t go to anyone else. 	2
Dr. Glick is great! My first experience working with a dermatologist and over found the right one. She’s knowledgeable, efficient and caring. I tell all my friends about her!	2
My six month old had a terrible diaper rash, and after seeing his pediatrician and doctors in the ER, Dr. Gluck was able to pinpoint the exact diagnosis and make this worried mom feel a lot better. Would definitely recommend for your pediatric dermatological needs. 	0
Dr. Glick is an excellent dermatologist! In speaking with me during my first session, she was patient, extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. During the annual skin check, I found her to be thorough. I will definitely return again. 	2
Dr. Glick is the best dermatologist I have ever had. I have had dermatologists abroad as well as in/outside of Boston and while these dermatologists were all very good, Dr. Glick really goes the extra mile. I found Dr. Glick when I first moved to NY about a year ago. I do not know what I would do without such a dedicated derm. She genuinely wants to help and think of the best solution while considering all factors.  In the year or so I have been seeing her, she has dramatically improved my skin.	2
Dr. Glick is wonderful ! She takes her time, explains everything.  Considerate,  caring-truly cares about her patient. You can actually feel it ! I am so happy to have found her and her staff. The office is clean and her assistant Natasha is the best ! 	2
Dr. Glick is an excellent dermatologist that is extremely knowledgeable and is efficient with her use of time.  You never feel rushed and she answers all of your questions. She will pick the best treatment plan for you, not just what is popular. She factors in your life, your responsibilities and what really works. She has early hours which is helpful when you need to run directly to work and she researches the best pricing for medication so that you don't have to incur an unnecessary cost.	2
What an amazing doctor. She is thorough, listens very well, and does her homework on every patient! A+++	2
As a health care provider, I am very picking about my own care. Dr. Glick is super knowledable, understanding, caring and compassionate. She will squeeze you in for any emergency at almost any time. Her bedside manner is also wonderful, which makes you feel at ease! I recommend her to anyone looking for a wonderful dermatologist!  	2
My experience with Dr. Glick exceeded my expectations.  She was attentive, thorough and exceedingly patient.  Her diagnosis was accurate and her recommended treatment cleared up the problem. More importantly, her prompt follow-up demonstrated her compassion toward her patients.  I highly recommend Dr. Glick!	2
Dr. Glick is my go-to dermatologist in NYC. I work in the beauty industry so I am very picky about my choice but I am always impressed by her thoroughness, her ability to identify problems quickly and treat them efficiently. I've been going to her for over a year now and she has helped me with many skin issues both cosmetic and medical. I would recommend her to all of my friends! 	2
Dr. Glick is in fact, one of the best in the world of the millennial physicians. She is efficient, thorough and definitely worth the trip to the upper east side. She has treated my tinea pedis at last!!!!!!! ;) ( no more stinky feet ) The quality of care is close to home! sometimes I feel so relaxed I just want to kick my shoes off. I have not only gained a great physician but a great friend as well. She also has a great assistant name Denisse, she is amazing. they both make a great team.!!	2
I would recommend Dr. Glick to anyone looking for an amazing, knowledgeable, personable and excellent dermatologist.  These days it’s not so easy finding an excellent practitioner who knows their stuff and cares about their patients!  Dr, Glick is a rare find and I’m happy to have found her!  	2
I had an appointment with Dr. Glick today for PRP. I have been struggling with hair loss for 5 years. The tedious treatment regimen of 2x daily applications of Rogaine didn't fit with my lifestyle and left my hair greasy. Dr. Glick recommended PRP for my male pattern hair loss. At first, I was nervous about the treatment because of the injections, but she talked me through it. I was comfortable throughout the procedure due to her tender touch and steady hand. Zach, her assistant, was great too!!	2
Dr. Glick is removing my tattoo. We did the first session and she made me feel so comfortable. She answered all of my questions and provided me with information on how to take care of my tattoo after each session. The whole process was very quick and I'm really excited to see my tattoo disappear all thanks to Dr. Glick! She is the best! 	2
Dr. Glick was unbelievably helpful and kind. I would recommend to her to family, friends, and you!	2
Dr glick is incredibly thorough and attentive. Truly cares about her patients. I highly highly reccomend 	2
Dr. Glick - I highly recommend. Went to her after a different dr “identified” too many issues. Thank gd I did because she was honest and confirmed my thoughts that other “dr” was  being aggressive and unnecessarily trying to get me to opt in for procedures. She was also attentive  and explained my scan and concerns with me. 	2
Dr. Glick is extremely caring and dedicated from the moment you walk in the door. I would highly recommend her to family and friends. She is through, smart and very easy to open up to with any issue.	2
Dr. Glick is a rare breed among doctors: incredibly informed on latest developments in dermatology, able to distill medical jargon into everyday terms, and tenacious in pursuing accurate diagnoses and optimal treatment. Moreover, she reaches that bar with an exceptionally thoughtful and compassionate bedside manner, all with a splash of appropriate humor. I feel thankful that I found Dr. Glick, and as dermatology needs arise in my life, I will look forward to subjecting myself to her future care	2
She looked at all my skin and addressed all of my concerns and more.	1
I love, love Dr. Glick over at Sadick Dermatology. Smart, kind, considerate, professional. My skin never looked better. Whenever I need a little pick me up, I call Sadick Dermatology for toxins/ filler or super model glow, I refer all of my friends and family to book with  Dr. Glick for medical and cosmetic treatments.	2
Dr Glick is an incredibly kind, compassionate and diligent dermatologist. I came to her with a cyst in a private area that was both painful and embarrassing, but was instantly made to feel at ease in her care. She possesses an exceptional bedside manner and exudes both professionalism and meticulousness at all times. Dr Glick made sure to follow up with me personally after my first visit and continued to treat me with care and kindness until the cyst was no more. I will most certainly be back. 	2
Dr. Glick was wonderful! She answered all of my questions and explained my treatment plan in detail. She made me feel very comfortable. I will certainly be going back for all of my skin concerns. 	2
Top notch board certified dermatologist! Reasons why I selected her 1.Listens to all my worries and concerns both medical and cosmetic. She makes me feel comfortable in her office and I never feel rushed. 2.She is able to access the issue/s and give a knowledgeable approach towards treatment. She answers questions honestly and gives you a clear understanding. 3.Response time is quick and she is available when I have questions. 4.Highly recommend you visit her office! You won't be disappointed.	2
Dr. Glick was so attentive to my needs as a patient.  I came to her regarding age spots and a blood vessel on my face.  Dr. Glick explained all of my options.  After one session, the blood vessel on my face is completely gone and I couldn't be happier.  I'll be returning to her for the brown spots, shortly. I would highly recommend her if you are looking for someone who is extremely honest, attentive, and conservative.	2
Dr. Glick is the best. She is professional, courteous and always remembers what we've discussed on a previous visit. She's also always on time -- I've never waited more than five minutes. I feel like she's my friend who makes me look and feel great. I recommend her to everyone looking for a dermatologist in New York.	2
Dr. Glick is fantastic she did my lip fillers and i absolutely love them!!  	2
Dr. Glick did a great job. She understood exactly what I wanted for my lip filler. She made me very comfortable, was gentle and I felt very little discomfort during the procedure. I am very happy and would definitely recommend her. 	2
Dr. Glick has given me great advice about my hand eczema and I am very grateful to her. 	2
worse than what i started with because he is in a big rush	0
my sister amanda and i love Dr. Brauer. he is an expert with lasers and all and genuinely kind person.  handsome too. he has been our dermatologist for the past 5 years and we trust him 100%.	2
Friendly, professional, caring, reassuring, well-qualified, and approachable.  Removed Basal Cell on nose using Mohs surgery.  Gave excellent explanation of procedure both of what he was going to do, how he was going to do it and explaining post-surgical care.  Excellent office staff. 	2
I cannot say enough good things about Dr Jeremy Brauer. I’ve been a patient since his days in NYC and I’m so happy that he’s practicing in Rye now. As a lifelong, fair skinned, beach goer my skin needed help and he’s done an amazing job. The Fraxel treatments have erased the sun spots and fine lines that dotted my face. He’s amazing at the medical side of things too, having caught and treated a few precancerous spots that I hadn’t even noticed. If you need a dermatologist, definitely see Dr Brauer!	2
"Dr. Brauer performed a laser treatment for my rosacea. It was initially planned that I would have two sessions and the results were that good, I only needed one session. Very happy and would highly recommend Dr. Brauer for treating rosacea. 

"	2
Dr. Brauer is the best. He walked me through and performed my excision with ease. I’ve had a great result with minimal scarring. I couldn’t be happier with my results. He has a wonderful disposition and completely puts you at ease. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an amazing dermatologist. 	2
"Dr. Brauer is a very caring and skilled Mohs surgeon who recently removed 2 basal cell cancers from my face, both in sensitive areas. I have had Mohs surgery twice before with other two other physicians, and this was, by far, my best experience. The recommendation to see Dr Brauer came from my dermatologist and she was right! He also has successfully treated other unrelated skin issues. He helped me a great deal and I highly recommend him for his skill and caring approach to his work.

I initially went to Dr. Brauer for a cyst on my face, to which he removed basically flawlessly with barely even a scar remaining. This past December, I began getting cystic acne (especially my chin). Each cyst would last up to 2 weeks and when one went away, another appeared. Dr. Brauer gave me a morning&night face care routine and an oral medication. It's nearly 3 months later and the cysts have disappeared entirely. I don't even wear face make up anymore! I could not be happier with the result	1
"Dr. Brauer is an excellent dermatologist.
I flew from Florida to New York for a procedure
to be performed by Dr. Brauer. I received AMAZING
results. Dr Brauer and his staff are kind and professional.
I would highly recommend him. 
"	2
"Dr. Brauer has an excellent bed side manner and puts you totally at ease.
As I have had many Mohs surgeries I have to say I was very uptight when it came to my nose.
I was totally satisfied as there is no residual scaring that one would ever see.

The office personnel and staff is very helpful and very professional.

I would highly recommend Dr. Brauer for anyone that needs Mohs surgery.
"	2
I have found a miracle worker! His name, Dr.Jeremy Brauer. He came highly recommended by a friend.  Dr.Brauer is so skilled that people (friends etc) are totally unaware that I had any thing done.  Responses like”oh you’v been on vacation, or your hair looks great are very common Remarks.  I have had fillers and a frameless laser treatment. I couldn’t be happier. My go to guy	2
I came across Dr. Brauer through my mom who went to him for a Mohs procedure (which came out beautifully). I consulted with him regarding a scar on my forehead that I've been self-conscious about for almost two years. Within 1 minute of looking, he identified that I still have stitches inside. I immediately scheduled an excision of the old stitches. Dr. Brauer made the procedure easy and painless, he even made me laugh throughout! I will continue to see Dr. Brauer as he is a great doctor! 	2
Dr. Brauer is the best dermatologist in the business and I've seen several in Manhattan. Right off the bat you can tell that he is interested in his patients' concerns and that he is thoughtful in his treatment approach. He's performed several laser procedures on my face and my husband's face. We wouldn't trust anyone else!	2
Dr. Brauer is not only a fantastic cosmetic dermatologist with excellent views of symmetry and aesthetics that he has applied to his practices, but his medical knowledge and expertise is not surpassed. He is warm, friendly and collaborative - making for the perfect patient/doctor experience. 	2
If you are looking for a dermatologist in the NYC area, GO TO DR. BRAUER!!!!! He is hands down the best doctor. He has the greatest energy about him, you never want to leave your appt!! Dr. Brauer makes sure that all your questions and concerns are fully answered before you start and after procedure. His knowledge and thoroughness throughout appointment allows you feel extremely confident in his recommended treatments. Dr. Brauer knows what he is doing and does it very very well!!! 	2
Very pleased indeed!  I am so happy to have found Dr. Brauer again.  I have been is patient for over 6 years.  He is an excellent Dermatologist who takes the time to listen and give this Irish lady (who grew up on the beach) the attention and thorough skin cancer screening needed.  Did I mention his cosmetic procedures are also top of the line!   The only Dr. I will go!  Always a pleasant experience, never feel rushed by a Dr. again!   	2
?No follow up or pre work with anyone from the office. Dr. was singing to Taylor Swift and tapping my chair instead of taking the procedure seriously. He didn't wait a beat for the injection to sink in or start working. This resulted in the WORST pain I have had in my entire life. It felt like cruelty. I was extremely swollen, couldn't put my arms down. It took me THREE MONTHS to have all of the feelings back in my breast/armpit/arm area. I received ZERO improvement. 	0
I have seen so many doctors and must say none quite as compassionate and dedicated as Dr. Brauer. I initially went to him for removal of a suspicious mole on my face but since have gone to him for several cosmetic procedures. He is very honest and will tell you if you do or don't need something.  His work is so natural looking-I just look younger without looking like I had something done.  You can tell he is so passionate about every aspect of what he does. I am so greatful I found him.	2
I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Brauer to discuss my alternatives for hair loss(PRP). upon my arrival i was kindly greeted by his staff. Although I was nervous at first after my consultation Dr Brauer made me feel at ease. I must admit the thought of having a bunch of needles injected into my head scared the life out of me but the procedure was quick and painless. I've had two treatments so far and i can already see some growth. I Highly recommend Dr. Brauer 	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Brauer.  I had the MiraDry procedure done and am 100% satisfied.  I was able to schedule appointments easily, the consultation was very informative, the procedure was painless and staff were all very friendly and accommodating.  	2
I visited Dr. Brauer's practice in search of a non-invasive solution to get rid of some stubborn belly fat. Dr. Brauer described a few options and recommend moving forward with Cool Sculpting. My experience with Dr. Brauer was excellent. He was patient in answering questions and discussing risks and he and his staff made my treatment very comfortable. Dr. Brauer is trustworthy, honest and has a great bedside manner. 	2
Dr, Jeremy A. Brauer and his team are AWESOME! They are even open on Sundays! After one Cool Sculpting Applicator and 6 weeks later,  I look great! The results and service have exceeded my expectations!	2
Dr. Brauer is really a caring, experienced and professional doctor who listens and is always concerned with the best for his patients, and it always adds to a pleasant experience when he throws in a few good laughs throughout consultations or warming up to procedures. I would highly recommend him, as I have been a devoted patient of his for approximately 3 years now. You will have a pleasant experience, guaranteed. 	2
"Dr. Brauer has a very warm and caring attitude towards his patients.
He is genuinely concerned for the well being of the patient and makes
you feel quite comfortable and confident that you are in good hands."	2
I specifically visited her because of the reviews and was disappointed.  She was not personable.	0

My first visit with Dr. Saif pleased me as my regular doctor was no longer available.  she was so thorough with my full body exam and pointed out tiny concerns and addressed them.  I have seen her several times now including a surgical procedure which was done so professionally and well.  I recommended her to my son and 11 year old daughter who were both very satisfied which says a lot when a child is at ease and reassured with concerns.  The staff is excellent from the reception area on.	2
had a good, reassuring visit with dr. saif. she let me know that i can come back anytime if i have anymore concerns	2
She is my favorite dermatologist and I have seen a lot. Listen, and does not try and make up answers like I have experienced in the past. Very accurate and not argumentative.	2
Walking into Certified Dermatology you are greeted by helpful receptionists. They took care of all of my questions. The wait was very short, where many offices have you waiting for 30 minutes or longer! Dr. Saif took care of all of my concerns. She was detailed in her diagnosis and answered all of my questions. I see myself coming back here for all of my dermatology needs.  Thank you Certified Dermatology!	2
Dr. Saif was very willing to help and assist me	2

I would recommend Dr. Ma to anyone. She puts you at ease immediately. I had to have a very large skin tag removed in a very private area. She was most understanding and had the tag removed in seconds. I felt no pain or discomfort whatsoever.	2
Very knowledgeable and caring doctor!	2
Dr Ma is AWESOME!!!!! If you go to her with any skincare issue or anything related to Dermatology best believe she will cure it and cure it fast!!! Highly recommend!!! Me and my daughter go to her.

"I got a laceration wound where huge piece of skin went off. The wound was treated in hospital EM and after that I came to Dr. Trivedi for consultation regarding my skin general condition and how to avoid this kind of trauma in future. 
To my surprise and disappointment doctor refused to open the wound and take a look at the skin there. He just prescribed the ointment to use on wound instead of that recommended in hospital. On second day of using this ointment wound condition sharply worsened, it started bleeding and hurting. I went to hospital again and was diagnosed with and got a treatment for wound infection. Obviously the ointment prescribed by Dr. Triverdi, was not good for my skin and didn’t work properly. 
I understand that doctor may give a medication which doesn’t work. But what I can’t understand is how he could to prescribe a strong and potentially aggressive treatment for the wound which HE DIDN’T OPEN AND DIDN’T TAKE A LOOK AT. Absolutely unacceptable for the doctor."	0
I had the exact same experience as L.M. from Monroe. The bathroom was appalling and it was a Monday so obviously nasty from week before. I was scheduled for a full body exam that he never did and once I told him one issue he didn't want to hear anything else. I know I have rosacea and he told me I don't, from across the room. He was never closer to me than 3 feet away at that computer. It's obvious from number/substance of positive reviews of all Certified doctors, they purchased them.	0
Horrible place ! The only one bathroom was grimy that looked disgusting !! What a shame!! The dr with very nice manners not even look on me all over my body always looking on his computer , he straight prescribed couple medicines that when I read the side effects I got so scare he sent me a drug with out know nothing of my general health condition... I ever goin go back there , he didn’t do a right ck up he don’t know what I have or what can be with 37 years of experience? I left very anguished.	0

Very positive experience!  Explained everything thoroughly!  Thank you!	2
My initial visit was in the Middlesex office. I left feeling very dissatisfied with the office staff and didn't feel much better with the doctor.  I came to the Old Bridge office & saw Dr Trivedi for a follow up and was very impressed with both the office staff-receptionist was super friendly & helpful- and the professional staff.  I felt so much better with the staff that I will be doing all visits at this office even though it is further from both my home & job.	2
Very thorough and fast and caring!! Yazmin was amazing and very caring as well!!!	2

Good	2
"Felt very comfortable,and at ease. Very confident of Dr. Trivedi's skills.
Will recomend to family and friends."	2
"I was able to get a first time appointment with Dr. Travedi in only 2 days. My last dermatologist's office always made me wait 6 months for an appointment and then they didn't do anything. My old doctor looked at my moles and told me not to worry about them. He said ""you're just a mosaic."" But Dr. Travedi says when they change colors like mine are they remove them. Skin cancer runs in my family on both sides so I really appreciated him taking that and all of my other issues seriously."	2
Had severe acne which I struggled for a long time . He helped me clear it in weeks and not any skin related issues I have always return back to his office.	2
Quick visits, but he was always willing to elaborate or further explain if I had any questions or concerns.	2
great	2
very happy with the 1st visit.	2
Walked in the room and knew exactly what to do and say. My little one felt comfortable, and left with a smile!	2
Good	2
Dr. Trivedi is very kind and worked well with my 2.5 year old. He explained everything very well.	2
everyone is very nice	2
It is not just the doctor but the office staff also.  Being able to talk to Dr. Trivedi, and have him treat me with respect. Giving me all the information to make a discision I can live with is important to me no matter how big or small the matter.	2
good and experienced dermatologist. visit is more productive if you clearly explain your prior condition and prior medication and responses. if you are not clear of prior medication used, starts off with mild prescription and takes longer for cure.	2
Came in for a minor operation and Dr. Trivedi was incredibly professional and effective.  Exceeded all expectations; I will be referring my friends and family.	2
DR TRIVEDI IS THE BEST DOCTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. HE CARED ABOUT ME AND MY PROBLEM AND HELPED TO FIND A SOLUTION. HE HAS THE SWEETEST SMILE AND BED SIDE MANNER I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY TO ANYONE. THIS IS ONE DOCTOR YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH!	2
Taking care of the issues. followup visits productive.	2
pieces cut out  things frozen off  what can i say	1
makes you feel comfortable and explains clearly.	2
"I have been coming to see doctor Trivedi for quite few years for various conditions, and have always received top notch care. Doctor is attentive to patient's concerns, provides very clear diagnosis and explanation, and has great follow-up.
Would strongly recommend, and in fact I have to my family."	2
I travel from Toms River to Old Bridge just to see him.	1
It's was great, very clean establishment, very professional workers and work enviroment. Wishes i could give more Stars	2

I scheduled the day before and was able to get an appointment with the PA, Barbara. There was no wait and Barbara was so patient - great bedside manner! I will definitely be coming back!!!	2
The front desk receptionist and medical assistant were well informed and welcoming. I truly felt comfortable. Dr. Weinberg was thorough with explaining my diagnosis and the medication provided is working miracles.	2
I was seen by Inessa the PA at the manhattan location and had a lovely experience. She was very knowledgable and sweet. Listened to my skin problem and prescribed a few medications. Also, she told me about the chemical peels that are offered and I'm so excited to try one next time I come in!	2
employees were very nice and professional. I lasted no longer than a hour ! Will be going back !	2
Dr. Weinberg is a kind and compassionate doctor.  He treats patients with respect and was especially professional with understanding regarding being tactful handling my mom who is 93 years young.	2
My experience with Dr. Weinberg and at his office was really bad, and I've actually never made a negative review. He spent little time with me, promised to follow up after I sent him requested information from another MD and I never heard from him again. He made an incorrect diagnosis and I had to pay for the appt. out of pocket after waiting over 2 hours because his office manager would not process my insurance even though the referral went through. Find another doctor. DO NOT GO TO HIM.	0
"After waiting 1.5 hours, my appt. with the doctor lasted at most 5 minutes.
He did not perform a skin exam as I requested and told me to take photos of my moles and come back if any had changed.
Rude, rushed, and uncaring.

My experience with Dr. Mian was great! She is extremely kind and professional. She listens to all your concerns and gives the best course of action that is suitable for you.	2
"As the son of a doctor that always stresses listening to the patient's concerns, clearly explaining issues, and allowing the patient to play an active role in treatment choices, I can fully attest to Dr. Mian's excelling on all these points!!
Looking forward to taking her on as my dermatologist with regularity. As a model, it is so important to have someone you trust with your skin."	2
"Went in for heat-related dry skin on my arms.  Didn't expect to be getting stitches but it was a smooth, painless process.

Would def recommend to a friend if any asked about dermatology."	2
The staff were great as always and Doctor Mian (first time with her) was great too	2
Very friendly staff, minimal wait time, the doctor was very nice, overall a great experience, will definitely come back here if ever in need of dermatologist.	2
I came in and was taken care of right away. Once Dr. Mian came in she was informative, and answered all questions thoroughly. I came in with a rash and she seemed to know what the underlying cause was, and came up with a quick solution. Hoping it works, but only time will tell! Find out next time, after my next visit in two weeks if the treatment worked or not. Overall, a very pleasant experience.	2
Everything from checking in to the actual examination was professional and quick. Dr. Mian was very clear in what she was doing and what could be expected. Definitely recommend.	2

Dr. Kiran is knowledgeable and gives her full attention.	2
Very happy with my first appointment with Dr. Mian. She was thorough and knowledgeable.	2

I did not have to wait and the doctor listened to me and addressed all my concerns and explained everything very thoroughly and carefully. Overall a very pleasant experience.	2
"A friendly and attentive doctor should not be a luxury. Fortunately, Dr Mian comes standard with the appointment. She's friendly, inquisitive, and effective in her profession.  She asked plenty of questions and listened carefully to all of my answers.  

I would happily sunburn myself just so i could come back and see her."	2
Thank you for the quick and through visit.  You are kind and so wonderful. I'm so happy to have found you.	2
This was the first time I saw Dr. Mian and I found her to be super friendly. She was thorough in her examination and made me feel very comfortable.	2
My first visit. Appreciate Dr. Mian's willingness to deal with multiple medical issues and suggest solutions I hadn't known about before.	2
Always a good experience here - even with issues that are not the most fun to talk about or basic checkups.	2
Today was my first appointment with Dr. Kiran Mian and she took the time to understand my concerns, address the science behind my condition and suggest ways to mitigate the condition in addition to prescriptions. Great overall experience.	2

Without hesitation I would recommend Dr. Mian - she and her team are kind, compassionate and go above and beyond to treat their patient.	2

I've been going to Dr Michele for 17 years.  My skin looks better than when I was 35. She works with my budget for maximum results!	2
I have always had a very good experience in her office.	2
I have been coming to Dr Michele for 10+ years.  My family does as well.  We are all delighted with our treatments.  She is not inexpensive but you get what you pay for and I trust her.	2
"At the age of 50 adult acne in not something I wanted to deal with.  But Dr Michele's treatment plan has helped me .
tremendously
My skin looks better than it has in 20 years.
Her kind and gentle demeanor leaves you with a feeling of genuine caring for her patients.
I look forward to every visit with her.
I feel blessed to have her as my physician"	2
Very easy visit and accurate diagnoses.	2
Dr. Gasiorowski always delivers the most subtle and refreshed look for the fillers that I do with her.  I make the trip from about an hour drive away from her office, with hundreds of other doctors that do botox and fillers, just because I know that she really is the best and has never dissapointed me in the 4 years that I have been coming to her.	2
baseline skin exam was easy, skin concerns addressed in a realistic way.  I love my recommendations and the staff is wonderful.	2
Always prompt and professional. Does seem to hurry a little. Sees many patients in a short period of time. Very good at injections, filler, cancer screening, product ideas, and referrals!	2

Regular patient.	1

"I have been coming for 20 years and would not choose anyone else! Michelle is knowledgeable, professional, and 
gentle."	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Michele for almost 10 years. Her work is subtle and immaculate. No one can believe my real age - 56 - or see any signs that I'm having work done - and it's all dermatology - no surgery.  Dr. Michele is incredibly skilled and has a great eye.  I should add that I am an architect and very fussy and detail-oriented about anything visual, and Dr. Michele meets and exceeds my standards.	2
Pleasant staff.  Dr. M. Gasiorowski explains everything as she is working on you which helps you relax	2
I never feel rushed and always feel Dr. Michelle listens to every concern I have, she gives great recommendations and treatments and is honest about results regarding possible needs to repeat a treatment. I have recommended this place to many friends.	2
I have always been pleased with my experience here.	2
I wouldtnot see anyone else ever	2
Farmingdale disgusting, think I got a rash just from being in there!	0
These reviews must be made up. Staff are young with no diplomacy or understanding whatsoever and D.O. Rachel Kushner is all about selling products and $$$... Need I say more? Office is filthy.	0
The reviews are misleading or done by people her friends or colleagues. I typically do not like reviewing. It is necessary to say she is the worst in her practice. I would not recommend her. Lifeless and baseless knowledge of symptoms. 	0
the dr was so nice answered all my questions  did not rush through visit	2
"I made a followup appointment to see Dr. Kushner.  Left work early, waited 50 minutes, then called into the exam room.  I asked, I am seeing Dr. Kushner, correct?  The reply was, ""Dr. Kushner is not here today, you will be seeing the P.A., she's just as good as Dr. Kushner and does the same job!""  If I wanted to see the P.A., I would not have distinctly made the appointment asking for Dr. Kushner.  Needless to say, I walked out.  Beware - very deceptive!"	0
Definitely would not recommend.  The wait was about an hour and 15 minutes and I received no help for an urgent/same day appointment for a condition I am told should be handled at a dermatologist's office.	0
Wait time was an hour and a half. Time spent with the doctor was less than 5 minutes. They required payment in advance even before seeing the doctor. The waiting room was inadequate, there were no cups in the water cooler and no toilet paper in the bathroom. The receptionist didn't seem to care one way or the other when I mentioned this to her. My prescription was incorrect when it was sent to the pharmacist. I was supposed to get three refills and they told the pharmacist 0 refills.	0
Wonderful!	2

"Dr. Kushner and her staff were extremely helpful and attentive.
Everyone was friendly and I was satisfied with my experience."	2
My daughter was diagnosed with a fungal infection, and prescribed cream. When I called the office to ask a question (three times), no one got back to me. Very poor follow up. Also, the Farmingdale office is dirty and has an odor. The PA who saw my daughter was very nice, but I wasn’t impressed with the rest of the staff.	0
I have been under the care of a different dermatologist for more than a decade for the treatment of  pigmentation around my face and I never notice any change. But with Dr. Kushner I started getting the result in 4 months and I'm on my way to get the remaining   (may be 15%) result. It is a pleasure working with Dr. Kushner and she is going to be my dermatologist for the rest of my life and l can strongly recommend her to anyone  I know   who have skin issues.	2
Doctor was thorough and staff was friendly.	2
very happy w Dr and staff!	2
The staff is helpful and the Dr. is caring and spends time with each patient. Would recommend the office!	2

Execellant dr	2

"The front desk staff, nurse and doctor were all warm and professional.  I was taken into my room on time and seen shortly after that.  I came for a cool sculpting procedure.  Everything was explained clearly and thoroughly by Maggie, the PA, and Tina.  They checked on me regularly, offering drinks and blankets to keep me comfortable during the procedure.
The office was clean and welcoming. Large updated and clean rooms.  It was a very positive experience and I would certainly come back again!"	2

Didnt have to wait long! Dr was very comforting.	2
Dr Kushner and her PA's Maggie and Sara are all great. I can honestly say that the office has a warmth and welcoming presence as soon as you walk in, and that's due to the young ladies in the front. They always greet with a smile and are willing to answer all of your questions. Its very important to have a great staff to run a successful office. Good Job	2

The girl who takes your information while you are waiting for the Dr is extremely comforting and Dr. Kushner is amazing.  I would highly recommend 5 stars all the way	2

Dr. G is the best! I've been seeing him for over 30 years and at the age of 52, my skin has never looked better. He is always ahead of the curve when it comes to new products and he sticks to what works and not what's hot at the moment. I won't let anyone else touch my face!	2
Doctor Gasiorowski is very knowledgeable and clear. His regimens are effective!	2

Dr. Henry Gasiorowski is excellent.  I have been a patient for many years, as have many family members.  He has been able to diagnose things other doctors have missed or misdiagnosed and is always up to date on the latest research and techniques.  I appreciate that the waiting room time is very minimal and the appointments are easy to book - he can usually see me within a few days at the most.   The 1:1 time can feel a little rushed so I have learned to advocate when I have more questions	2
From the beginning when Dr. Ratner's staff explained how things worked through the various medical procedures, I always had a clear idea of what was happening. Regarding the surgery itself, Dr. Ratner made every effort not only to deal with the cancer (which was by my knee) but also to ensure that I would have no problems walking. Dr. Ratner & her staff have my sincere and heartfelt gratitude for their efforts.	2
I had an amazing experience with Dr. Ratner. I had to have something removed from my upper-lip in a very difficult spot and it healed beautifully. She is timely, talented, personable and simply wonderful in every way (as is her staff). 5 stars all around from procedure to instructions and follow-up and care. I am grateful to have been referred to her for this procedure and thank her for her work :)	2
"Dr. Ratner not only was she good and understanding, gave of her time to help me through a difficult period, and today I am fine.
Her Staff was excellent and extremely helpful and friendly."	2
Dr. Ratner and her staff are everything one hopes for in a physician and office.  The experience from start to finish considers the patient's well being above all.  Efficient and personable, her assistants remember you from one visit to the next, and their excellent care supports hers completely.  Thank you!	2
dr ratner, is an excellent surgeon, her work is impecable,and a lovely women1 leah karfunkel	2
"No comparison to previous experiences in other medical settings. Not only is Dr Ratner tops in her field but she has established a practice in a setting that is so welcoming, so calm,so pleasant,so caring! She obviously knew what was needed and made sure to include it all.
Bravo Dr Ratner! There need to be more like you and your staff!"	2
Dr. Ratner removed a skin cancer on my nose. She did a wonderful job. It was painless and the results are terrific. One can barely see that I had stitches on my nose.	2
efficient and knowledgeable. Overall a very easy experience	2
Not only Dr.Ratner, but everyone in her office, gave 100% fine care.  My treatment was perfectly explained and carried out - I can heartily recommend this professional practice to other patients.	2

Don't hesitate when she is recommended."	2

"This is the third time i have had Dr. Rattner  perate on my face 

This the third Mohs surgery Dr. Ratner has performed on me. I trust her implicitly. No one ever sees the other two as she so sikillfully places the operation. Everyone in the office is helpful, kind and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Ratner.

Excellent care.  Karen was particularly helpful	2
outstanding in every sense of the word.	2
MOHS surgery under left eye	1

Thank you to everyone!"	2

Her staff is incredible- so helpful and caring and her Office is SO clean! Its rare to find a perfect everything in NYC and by far she has it! I thank her and her staff!

Having skin cancer is scary enough. Experiencing it for a second time, on my face, is terrifying. As an executive in the beauty industry - where appearances matter - I was dismayed by the results of my first Moh's surgery with another physician. It left me disfigured for months. When I came to Dr Rattner with my second skin cancer, I was so concerned and upset. Her truly caring spirit coupled with an expert, on point approach was heartwarming. Dr Rattner is a far superior...	2
Great experience. Great staff.	2
"Dr. Ratner is clear on what to expect.  I went to her when she was previously at Mt Sinai for mohs surgery and when I found out that she had opened up her own practice I wanted to continue with her.  Dr. Ratner's staff are wonderful. 

Thank you - all - for taking care of me."	2
ratner was absolutely amazing. i felt very comfortable and my experience was excellent.	2
I came in very stressed and left feeling much better after she explained everything to me.  Her assistants were very helpful.	2
very calm and assuring.	2
From the moment  I walked into the office I was impressed with the professionalism and clear explanations from each and every person with whom I interacted.	2
"Terrible, terrible. 

She bullied me into letting her do a biopsy on my face when I wanted to take it to a plastic surgeon. Now I have a jagged, permanent scar.

I’ve never written a review like this, but I want to keep other people from making the same mistake."	0
"Dr. Ratner is absolutely brilliant. She makes you feel safe. She knew how scared I was, and was reassuring and sympathetic. She kept me informed every step of the way and talked me through the hour-long surgery so I never felt just like ""the patient"" but a human being. I had surgery on my face and the wound is already healing amazingly well. As for her nursing staff, every single one of them was kind, funny, and informative. I could not recommend this doctor more highly."	2
"Very calming kind and professional. 
Would highly recommend. Scar has healed better after 3 weeks than any other scar I have ever had.  Would most definaty use Dr. Ratner again and highly recommend.  Everyone I came across in office could not have been nicer. "	2
Although she may be technically competent, she has a personality disorder.  No bedside manner.  Does not fully give information on what to expect and appears annoyed afterwards if you ask questions.  I felt as if I were a part on an assembly line, not a patient.   There are many Mohs surgeons in NYC, I found another one for subsequent skin cancer surgery and am pleased...but I suggest you run, don't walk away, from this schizo.   The other factors you track are nice but this is more important!	0
She's a fine doctor, but she offers ZERO post-op information. I would like to have been told to expect to have a black eye the next day. For another procedure, I should have been told that the incision would take more than TWO YEARS to heal completely. 	2
"The doctor's misjudgement made it necessary to repeat a surgical excision.  Should not have been necessary if appropriate margins had been observed the first time.

Staff was friendly, but the assistant who removed sutures missed two or three which caused considerable discomfort for a very long month."	0
I have never met a more caring and knowledgeable doctor who actually hears you. He is no rush. You are the only person in his life.	2
Might be the best experience I've had in going to see a doctor. I showed up 5 minutes early, forms completed in 3-4, and got pulled in right away. Full exam was thorough and answered all my questions patiently and thoroughly.	2
the kindest doctor with the most intuitive sense of whats going on with you that i have ever met	2
Well I had 3 visits and they were the best ever.  Each time I left her office I saw an huge difference, but no one else said a word.  I saw friends, and family and no one ask me if I did anything.  It was a slow easy process, with the end resualts of me looking and feeling 10 plus years younger.  She knew just how much to do and when to stop.  I would trust her with my MOTHER because you can tell right away she does things from the heart.  She has helped me more than she will ever know, and I hope if your at the point that you need a pick me up.  She is the BEST.	2
I feel confident in her competence and knowledge and appreciate her friendly and courteous manner.	2
Dr. Georgina is nothing short of amazing. I found her very attentive and straight to the point . In 15-20 minutes she addressed each and every concern, prescribed necessary medications and gave me an injections for a small fibroma I had on my arm. She is extremely knowledgeable and super gentle with her injections. I cant wait to come back for my recommended treatment! Highly recommend her!	2
Awesome Dr!	2
Dr. Ferzli and her team were absolutely amazing. Dr. Ferzli's consultation was very informative and she spoke with me about what would/would not work for my skin tone and texture. I explained that I wanted subtle results, and I could not be happier. It's been a month since my procedure and I am still glowing, it seems as if my skin improves every day!	2
I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Ferzli. She helped me create a plan to fight my acne, and went over in detail why she was suggesting what she was suggesting. I am excited to have found a doctor who seems to really care and put effort into fighting acne without trying to prescribe me a pill and call it a day. 5 Stars!	2
I've seen so many dermatologists and this is by far the best one. She has GREAT listening skills and understands my concerns completely. She also really cares about cutting the cost for you as much as possible, which is very considerate. Overall, very happy with the appointment.	2
Dr. Ferzli is amazing. I have been to quite a few dermatologists and she was by far the best I've seen. I had a pretty bad flare up on my face over the weekend and her office was able to squeeze me in last minute! I am so appreciative. She is thorough, personable and I'm very grateful.	2
Excellent	2
I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Ferzli. She really took the time to listen to my issues and concerns and came up with a very clear game plan. Very easy to talk to and very genuine. Def recommend seeing her!	2
Really cares about her patients and thoroughly explains everything she's prescribing. Very helpful in determining the best skincare routine for your needs. Highly recommend!	2
I have say I was a bit nervous coming in and Dr. Ferzli answered all my questions and made me feel a lot more comfortable. I can tell she really cares about her patients. Thanks	2
So thankful I found Dr. Ferzli. She is without question one of the most compassionate doctors I have ever met.	2
This was my first appointment with Dr. Ferzli. She was pleasant, thorough and quick. Great experience!	2
exellent	2
She was very nice.	2
Great Experience! She was very knowledgeable and listen to every question I had. Would highly recommend!	2
Dr. Ferzli explained my conditions in a very understandable way.  She also prepared me for all the procedures she was going to perform on my that day.  What to expect following treatment was understandable as well.	2
Dr. Ferzli took care of me last minute before my acne got out of control for a beach weekend. Can't say enough nice things about this practice!	2
Very informative and kind.  Explained my options clearly and was quick to help me with my skin issues.	2
Excellent, professional service and friendly, competent office staff.	2

My first time visiting this practice.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and organized.  Dr. Noor and his assistant were both very thorough and professional in explaining procedures to me and helping me feel completely comfortable.  I feel I can certainly put my trust in Dr. Noor for all my future dermatological needs!	2
Everything was excellent, he is knowledgeable and pleasant, listened to my opinion about what I wanted then explained why he suggested a different course of action. I never felt that my exam was being timed, his focus was on me. The front office was also great, no waiting, clean and friendly all the way	2
He was on time and very informative.	2
Had my first visit at RAO this past week. What a great experience, Dr. Noor addressed all my concerns and was very knowledgeable.

"Dr. Noor is the best. I must have my skin checked regularly due to skin cancer. He treats me with compassion and understanding.  Getting reoccurring skin cancer and precancerous spots is very upsetting, h e takes time to explain and to thoroughly check my skin and ease my anxiety.  
Dr. Rao  has performed surgery and did an excellent job with stitching and almost no scarring.  The office staff is very polite and very quick to respond to phone calls and questions. This office, doctors and staff are the best I recommend them all the time

I had dry scalp and pimples on my scalp. Dr. Noor examined my condition and suggested a medication and shampoo for each condition. I see major improvements while on these medications. I would recommand this doctor and be back next time. 	2

I normally schedule my visits with Dr. Rao, so when they told me Dr. Noor was the only person available on the day I needed, I was apprehensive. However, upon arrival to my appointment, I was taken promptly as always and Dr. Noor was professional, reassuring, and knowledgeable.	2
Dr. Noor is an excellent physician and always kind, caring and compassionate.  Each visit has been a positive experience?.  Thank you Dr. Noor. 	2

"First visit to this Doctor and his Atlantic Highlands Office. First impression- I thought I walked into a Hollywood set. The Lobby is very sleek and inviting. Miss Lauren and her coworkers couldn’t have been nicer. Fast and efficient. I hadn’t even finished the paperwork and was already being cared for. 

Dr. Noir was personable and very well informed about insurance coverages as well as his medical knowledge

For my needs I was in AND out of the office in 15 minutes. GOLD STAR! "	2
He is an amazing board certified dermatologist.  I highly recommend him.  Great office. Friendly staff. 	2
I highly recommend Dr Noor ! He has a gentle and nice bedside manner and knows what he is doing. 	2
Dr. Noor is a wonderful doctor.  He has a very gentle touch.  Also, very down to earth.  Explains everything in detail.  He also has a very calm way about him which helps if you're an anxious patient like me!	2
Both my husband and I go to Dr. Bae when we need to see a dermatologist.  Dr. Bae is knowledgeable, compassionate, patient, and thorough.  I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a derm in NYC.	2
Very professional and thorough.  Examined entire body for any irregular marks or spots.   Put me at ease by answering all my questions.   Highly recommend. 	2
This was my first visit. She was lovely, engaging and very thorough. I had a complete body check and I felt very comfortable with her. I have already suggested my husband see her as well. 	2
She is so nice and soft spoken. Made me feel comfortable when examining me. Her prescription cure my issue within a week. Will definitely go back!	2
Dr. Bae is experienced but lacks a considerate kind demeanor. She’s self absorbed and not interested in her patients leaving happy. She will absolutely try to sell you on other procedures, and her way of saying it may not feel right. I didn’t need her saying my eyes are sunken in as I wasn’t there for my eyes anyway. She’s suggested fillers on two occasions and I really don’t think I need it. Thanks for trying to make me feel ugly! Oh ya, don’t be late, she will gladly turn you away. 	0
I was very happy with Dr. Bae. She has a good bedside manner and made me feel at ease. I definitely recommend her!!!	2
The Doctor’s  visit was a PLEASURE professional courteous and to the point.  I would have no problem recommending her and the staff to others.  I have.  Thank you, R. Nieves 	2
"Dr Bae was
Awesome!!! Highly recommend her. "	2
"Very helpful And efficient. I got the answers in wanted and had a small Procedure done. I did not feel the needle which is what I am Always scared of- i will
Def recommenced to my friends 
"	2
Horrible bedside manner and curt. You literally have to pry information from her as if she's not getting paid for her services (even though she charges $400+ just for a consultation fee). She doesn't care about the happiness of her patients and she really is not skilled at what she does. 	0
"Dr. Bae is the absolute best at what she does. 

She has done what no other doctor could. She cured my lifelong struggle with acne.

Aftering seeing Dr. Bae for the first time I started seeing results within 24 hours and after a couple of weeks I was clear for the first time in my life. 

She is an absolute joy to see. I always leave her office feeling extremely excited and hopeful about my self and my skin.
"	2
Dr. Bae is down to earth, professional and is truthful about what you need and don’t need.  GREAT bedside manor which is needed during some of the procedures. 	2
Dr. Bae is the best!  She takes the time to listen to all of my concerns and is very thorough in explaining the options that I have.  I came to Dr. Bae after seeing multiple doctors regarding a skin condition.  The other doctors diagnosed my skin condition to be something else that it was not.  Dr. Bae looked at my skin and new exactly what was needed to be done to help fix the problem.   Thank you, Dr. Bae.	2
"Any time I have skin problems, I go to Dr. Bae.   When I need Botox, laser treatments,  and fillers, I go to Dr. Bae.  When I have questions about skin products, I go to Dr. Bae..
She is knowledgeable, compassionate, and brilliant.  I recommend her to anyone who is looking for a dermatologist."	2
I would highly recommend Dr Bae! I had filler and Botox done by her and I have to say she has an artists hand. She listened to my concerns and fully corrected them. I didn’t want anything drastic just subtle and she did a beautiful job! I didn’t have any bruising and am enjoying all the compliments I get! If your interested in cosmetics she’s the one for you!	2
I have had chapped lips for years. When I discussed my main problem of concern on my lip, Dr. Bae immediately was concerned and wanted to biopsy the area. Dr. Bae was very compassionate with my concerns and reassured me that we will treat according to the results. I ended up having a pre-cancer and I'm so pleased with her thoroughness, excellent care and bedside manner.	2
Meeting with Dr. Bae was an overall great experience. She addressed my issue along with all of my many questions and concerns. She was very warm and welcoming. Her recommendations were on point and helped me. I will be sure to recommend her to my friends	2
I went to Dr. Bae because my primary Dr. diagnosed me with Perioral Dermititis but referred me to a dermatologist for confirmation.  My appointment with Dr. Bae lasted less than 3 min. where she proceeded to wrongly diagnose me, prescribe me medication that made my condition WORSE and walked out of the room before I could even ask a single question.  I was left speechless from the lack of time and care that was given to me.  I had to go to a different dermatologist the next day for proper care. 	0
 I had an  appointment  with Dr. BAE. I found her to be not very thorough, indifferent, and slightly arrogant. She barely looked at me and gave me a diagnosis. She seemed very bored and not at all interesteted in my problem. I would not recommend this doctor.	0
"Unfortunately I can only click on 5 stars.  Dr Bae deserves 5 billion stars! !!   Having had many many doctors in our lives, Dr Bae is not only one of my families  very best doctors she has also became our good friend.  Her care doesn't stop when you leave her office, her care is never ending and her results are even better then her bedside manner. 
We found our pot of gold when we found Dr Bae
Cathy from Brooklyn "	2
This has been one of the most unprofessional medical practices I have ever dealt with throughout my years.  I scheduled a first appointment for my teen daughter , which the office called the day prior to inform me that the appointment needed to be rescheduled for the following week because Dr. Nichols needed to leave early.  Now I received another call today canceling the rescheduled appointment because Dr, Nichols needs to leave early again. Just wasted two weeks!  So unprofessional!	0
had a hysterctomy done and Dr Pinell was very sweet and caring during and after my surgery. answer all my questions and concerns and do not regret doing my surgery at all..Thank you so so much Dr PP and staff for being there.	2
"Dr. Phillip Pinell is a very brilliant, caring physician.  He has taken his time and listens
to my concerns. I am honored to have him as my physician."	2
Dr. Pinell listens to all medical issues and concerns.  He considers the side effects of my medications when treating my current problems.  I highly recommend him.	2
I was on hospital bedrest for three months for my surprise pregnancy.  I was stunned by the level of care I recieved from Dr. Pinell.  He was so attentive, gracious and personable every single time I saw him, both in office and then eventually in the hospital.  I didn’t feel I needed a high risk doctor, but I am so thankful I had him.  I would send anyone to see him that needed care.  All of my visitors and family were most impressed with his bedside manner and medical knowledge and discernment.	2
I love Woman's OB/Gyn Specialists, not only are the ladies in the front helpful and always smiling. Dr. Pinell is the best, I recommend them to all of my friends and family. Dr. Pinell listens to me and answers all of my questions. He makes me feel comfortable and that is what I was looking for. 	2
Dr. Pinell has been my OB for 13 years now. I cannot thank him enough for being there all the time for me and my family! The best doctor ever, genuinely compoassionate adn always with a caring heart. Highly recommended.	2
Dr. Pinell and his staff are amazing! Always feel welcomed and minimal to no wait time. 	2
Dr pinell is the best Dr ever! I’ve been with him for 21 years, have referred numerous friends to him and even flew to Houston to see him when I had moved. He’s the best at what he does!	2
"Dr. Pinell is by far the physician I've seen.  I had an OBGYN that I saw for years prior to becoming pregnant.  Once I found out I was pregnant, I was not happy with her bedside manner.  Fortunately a friend of mine, who is also a physician, referred me to Dr. Pinell.  She called him ""the doctors doctor"".  I have never been happier.  Dr. Pinell was very attentive, open, and warm throughout my entire pregnancy and thereafter.  I trust him wholeheartedly and am so thankful to be his patient. "	2
"I've been a patient of Dr. Pinell's for over 24 years and will not go to another obgyn.  He has always listened, made himself available, returned my calls (even after hours ) and genuine.

His staff are pleasant and understanding."	2
Doctor please how do i contact you directly apart from your email.I am an expectant mom and carrying my second pregnancy. I am a resident of Nigeria alongside my family.Kindly let me know if you accept international patients	1
Dr. Pinell is one of the best OBGYNs in the country.  He is a brilliant doctor with the kindest of bedside manners and genuinely one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  He has set the bar very high for what I expect out of doctors and I have realized how blessed I have been to have found a doctor like him to deliver all five of my children.  	2
Dr. Pinell is the best.  He is always so friendly. 	2
I had the greatest experience with Dr. Pinell; after 6 months of doctor hopping I finally came across his name from my insurance company and I also got a great recommendation from my gyno Dr. Lisa Otey who he once mentored. From our first visit I knew he was the one that was going to deliver my twin babies. He made sure to be as honest as he can be regarding the risks of having a natural vagina birth for my twins. Thanks for not giving up on me	2
Dr. Pinell is the most caring gentle doctor. I have been with him for over 17 years.  Would recommend him above anyone else. Delivered 2 of my children 1 of them being a high risk pregnancy. Love love love Dr. Pinell.	2
Extremly caring staff.  Never had a doctor experience as personal as Dr. Pinell.  	2
Dr. Pinell has the best bedside manner. He is very sweet and understands the stressfulness of women's health and check-ups. He is very attentive and you never feel like you are a number or that you are being rushed through your appointment. He is also a skilled surgeon. He delivered my last child and performed my hysterectomy 11 years later. I completely recommend Dr. Pinell to anyone seeking a great physician.  	2
Today January 8 2018 was my first appointment with Dr. Pinnel. It was the best experience ever. His bed side manners were impressive and he made sure to make sure I understood everything and was ok. When he first cane into the room and saw my daughter he made her a glove balloon. Most doctors do not acknowledge family members in the room. I highly recommend him to anyone. My husband couldn’t believe how great he was. Also my appointment was for 2pm and we were called exactly at 2	2
I would readily recommend Dr. Pinell to others. He is friendly, caring, full of information, and interested in me as his patient. He has an eye to my wellbeing in the future.	2
As a first time mom, Dr P is exactly who you want alongside you during this journey! Calming, knowledgeable and caring with great bedside manner 	2
Dr. Pinell is a kind, compassionate doctor. He takes the time to answer each question I have about my pregnancy. I feel very confident in his abilities as a doctor. I have been so grateful to have him as my doctor and I recommend him to all my pregnant friends!	2
Dr Pinnell is the best he's very sweet and caring good at explaining everything,and very attentive ! He makes you feel comfortable always and always shows he cares! Best obgyn ever, he's delivered all my children and is now delivering my children's children! I would definitely recommend him!	2
Dr. Phillip Pinell is a wonderful doctor that delivered both of my children.  He is a well-rounded physician that knows how to relay medical information to the patient in a very comforting/caring way.   I have moved on from the Obstetrics stage now and have been seeing Dr. Pinell every year for my gynecological needs.,  He continues to exceed my expectations as a physician.  Now my only worry is that he does not retire anytime soon.  Also, he works with the best medical staff!!!!	2
Had my first OB visit with Dr. Pinell. This is my first child and he made my visit comfortable and genuinely seemed like he cared. I'm excited to have him as my doctor throughout this first pregnancy! 	2
Dr Pinell is very compassionate and listens to his patients.I 	2
Dr. Pinell has been my doctor for over 18 years. He explains in detail everything about my health. Very professional and caring. I want to personally thank him and his staff for being there for me. 	2
LOVE Dr. Pinell! As a NICU Registered Nurse working in the healthcare field myself, I genuinely value the way he takes his time doing patient teaching and answering the numerous amount of questions I have- no matter how busy his day may be. He truly prioritizes YOU- YOU (and your family) are the most important people when he is with you. As his patient, I am confident that I am not just a patient to be treated, but a human being with emotions and desires to be empathized with and respected.	2
As a brand new father of a beautiful daughter, I am very glad I chose Dr. Pinell as our doctor for the delivery. We were new patients and consider ourselves very lucky that he took us on. We had many appointments and he took his time to talk to us an explain every stage of the pregnancy. I arrived late to one of out appointments and he made sure to redo the ultrasound and show me the baby anyway! He made my wife feel like she was in safe hands, and is one of the best doctors I've seen.	2
I am very grateful that I found Dr. Pinell after I moved to Houston.  I had a difficult labor with my first daughter but Dr Pinell knew what to do and he brought our beautiful daughter safe to the world. Every time I visit with him, he takes the time to listen and to answer all my questions. I highly recommend Dr. Pinell. 	2
Always a great experience with Dr. Pinell, professional and an amazing person and doctor. 	2
Dr. Pinell is simply a pleasure to visit. He makes not only me feel comfortable, but my husband is equally as comfortable and confident with our visits with him. He is one of the most caring physicians I have ever had. Even though I've moved out of Houston to The Woodlands, I still drive down to make our appointments.	2
Love Dr. Pinell and all his staff. Best manners, clean office, friendly staff, and always helpful.	2
Professional and skillful in his field. 	2
I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Miller.  Last September I did my annual wellness exam where a breast lump was discovered.  She expedited getting me a mammogram which ended up being cancer and, more importantly, hooked me up with a wonderful surgeon to have a mastectomy done (Dr. Bonefas).  She personally followed up with multiple phone calls to check on me which I truly appreciated.  	2
I was there for my annual exam. I love Dr Miller and her nurse. They listen closely to everything you say. I love that you know they truly care about how you feel and if you are healthy. I pray that I never have to see anyone else!	2
Dr. Miller spent a lot of time with me prior to the exam to get my full medical history.  She spent time getting to know me and my health concerns. Overall, I am happy to have an Ob-gyn who did not treat me like the cattle call in and out (no pun intended) doctors I have had in the past. Time and relationship building is important to me in a health care provider.  Also, the office is very nice and well decorated- not some institutional hospital like setting.	2
Dr. Miller is the best!  I've recommended her to several and all have been very impressed and are still patients.	2
Dr. Jonna Miller is a consistently superb physician who is always thorough, caring, cheerful, proficient and, above all,  listens to her patients. Her staff is equally as kind and professional. It's been a blessing to have been her patient for these 15 years. Thank you.	2
Dr. Miller is the best along with her team. I was referred to her in 2013 by a friend after i had a bad experience with a prior doctor during my high-risk pregnancy. Since day 1 she has provided nothing but the best care and I wish I could pick her up take her with me as I uproot my family to the Dallas/Ft.Worth area. She answered every question(and we had tons), great bedside manner, never cancelled on me and never rushed any of my appointments.	2
Love her!	2
My experience with Dr. Miller was great! I am new to the area, and everybody around me used her. I found her to be thorough and kind. 	2
Dr. Miller is fantastic and I love her.  She always takes the time to sit and talk about any and all issues with you each visit.  I have never felt that she was too busy to listen and have never felt rushed during my office visits.  She has been my doctor since 2002 and I refuse to go anywhere else!!  She has delivered all of my children and is starting to see them as a physician as well.  You cannot go wrong with Dr. Miller!	2
I recommend Dr. Miller to anyone who is looking for an OBGYN! She has been my doctor through 2 pregnancies and I have no complaints. Office staff is very friendly and helpful. She even checked in while on vacation when I had my son. Very caring and always friendly. 	2
I am a new patient at this wonderful organization. They were referred by my sister and so happy I went. Front desk and the whole staff are very welcoming and helpful. Dr. Miller was so sweet, caring, helpful and very knowledgeable on what she does. I will never go anywhere else. 	2
Dr. Miller has been my doctor since 2002. She is such a sweet and caring doctor. She listens very well to my concerns and has given me great care from a young woman to having babies and most recently with my hysterectomy. 	2
Dr. Miller and staff are excellent for every stage of womens care. They are calm, reassuring, and helpful.	2
"The Pearland location is wonderful and Dr. Miller is always a great person. She listens to me and is not one to fuss. I appreciate her honesty and easy going nature. 

"	2
Dr. Miller is a fantastic doctor, she gave up her lunch hour to fit me in for a procedure. Thank you Dr. Miller, you and your team are wonderful.	2
Dr. Miller has been my doctor for over 15 years!  She was there through both my pregnancies and always answered any of my questions.  My second delivery had some complications and because of Dr. Miller, both my baby and I were fine.  She has always been proactive with me as I have a family history of ovarian cancer.   As I am getting older, she has been nothing but awesome! She’s ALWAYS listens, which I find rare in doctors.  I purposely pick my insurance plan that has Dr. Miller in network.	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Miller	2
Great bedside manner, friendly staff, excellent service & care. 	2
Dr. Miller is an excellent doctor.  She makes you feel very comfortable in an uncomfortable situation as having a pelvic exam.  She treats you as you were a friend not just another patient.  She will sit an talk with you as long as need be, even though she has other patients.  She never make you feel hurried.  She genuinely cares about your health and wants the very best for you. I would recommend her to every women from young adult to childbearing, through menopause and beyond.  She is awesome!	2
I love Dr. Miller.  She is so easy to talk to and is very thorough.  So glad I chose her.  I have great confidence in her ability to treat anything that may come up.	2
I have been a patient of Texas Women's for 27 years.  I first met Dr. Miller when she was delivering my first Grandson 7 years ago and was so impressed with her bedside manner I switched to her.  She is  thorough and takes the time to listen to concerns as well as not making you feel rushed.  She is very professional and compassionate.  I highly recommend her as well as Texas Women's Hospital so much so, I drive 3 1/2 hours to see her..	2
Dr Miller is very thorough and knowledgeable.  She takes her time with you and makes sure you feel comfortable and understand everything.  She will put you at ease.	2
Dr. Miller is very professional, personable, sensitive, and listens to her patients. 	2
Dr. Miller is the best doctor that I have had due to the fact that she actually sits with you and listens. She explains everything to you in a way that you can understand and there's not a long wait time on your appointment day. 	2
Dr. Miller is very personable and easy to talk to.  She doesn't rush through your appointment, and tries to make it less awkward (going to the gyno is always awkward for me).  The staff and wait time have greatly improved from a few years ago.  I'd definitely recommend her!	2
She has great bedside manner and is very thorough. I felt like all my needs were addressed.	2
I would recommend Dr Miller to all friends and family.  She is through and concise in offers information to better your health.  She and her staff are AWESOME!!!	2
I have always used my general practitioner for my well woman  exams but obviously that had to change when I became pregnant. A friend of mine recommended Dr. Miller so I decided to give her a try. I absolutely love having her as my OB/Gyn. She's very pleasant and informative. Her bedside manners are great. She makes me feel very comfortable during exams and is extremely thorough. She's very personable too. She's very experienced and she worked her magic and helped make my delivery go smoothly! 	2
Dr. Miller is awesome! The best bedside manner, answers all of your questions- takes any of your  concerns seriously.  I've had 2 c-sections with her with easy recovery and no scar tissue- great surgeon as well! 	2
I have gone to HWC for the last 15 years. They have always been very efficient and caring for my care. Dr. Miller goes out of her way to answer questions and follow up with pt tests and concerns. Her  bedside manner is excellent, and I would highly recommend her services, no matter what your age or reason to visit and OB/GYN. 	2
Dr. Miller is a wonderful doctor. Not only is she an extremely knowledgeable doctor she is very compassionate. I have always had a great experience with Dr. Miller and her staff and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a OBGYN!	2
The office was convenient to my work location and the staff was courteous and friendly. Dr. Miller took time with me to explain different treatments. She was very thorough and knowledgeable. She was easy to talk to and kind. I am glad to have found her.	2
Dr. Miller is an awesome provider and her personal touch and ability to connect with each of her patient's makes the visit experience an awesome one. So far, she's the best gynecologist I've seen in the last twenty years. 	2
She was incredibly friendly and made sure I was comfortable with her before we got to the reasons for my visit.  She came highly recommended by my sister and sister in law who have seen her for years. Yes she is as good as they say. 	2
Dr Miller is very caring and an attentive physician. Me and my husband were very happy about the care and support we received from her. I would definitely recommend Dr Miller. She is the best!	2
Dr. Miller is a GREAT doctor.  She is very down to earth and practical. 	2
Dr. Fu was very kind, compassionate , considerate to me.	2
Dr. Fu is amazing, I cannot say enough great things about her.  I am so glad that I chose her as my ob/gyn. Not very many times do you truly get to say you love your doctor. 	2
Wonderful doctor! She explains everything really well. Makes you feel so comfortable. Answered all my questions and concerns. Highly recommend! 	2
Dr. Fu is amazing!!! She listened to everything I had to say and went right to work to figure out how to fix me. I’m so glad I went to her. I should have gone to her years ago! Thank you to Dr. Fu and her amazing staff for all of their help!	2
Many years ago I worked in marketing for a Chicago area hospital.  Our department set-up M.D.'s into their first practice as they finished residency.   Some of the M.D.'s had an attitude, i.e. were rather arrogant.  My boss would refer to them as M.Deities!  Dr. Fu is not an M. Deity!  She is the sweetest, nicest OB/Gyn physician I have ever been a patient of.   She is very caring and down-to-earth.   She also has equally nice assistants.  I very much appreciate this level of care.  	2
Dr. Fu really listened to me, my health issues/concerns and took the time to explain/talk to me about them and then figure out what to do to correct the issues.  She is very kind, knowledgeable and thorough.  I appreciated her not rushing me during my appointment.  I will definitely keep seeing her for my OBGYN needs and would highly recommend her to anyone.  I've moved around over the past 20 years and had about 5 different OBGYN's and she is the best of the best.  	2
Outstanding, professional, heartfelt medical provider. 	2
Dr. Fu is amazing!  She is very caring--patiently answering questions, listening carefully, and giving ideas regarding my health and wellness!	2
Have been very satisfied with seeing Dr Fu but seems difficult to get routine appointments as she is scheduled so far out. 	2
I had my annual checking visit  with the fabulous Dr Fu ..  I had the best visit which I always have and look forward to have with Dr Fu .. I was treated like royalty  as always , professional and detailed.  Dr Fu is human before being a professional doctor , she listens , assure one and  gives you all the time to listen .. I would recommend Dr Fu for her nice pleasant  professional personality as a doctor  .. Her annual visit gives me positive vibes till the next year when I see her .. 	2
She’s pretty much the bees knees (the highest of excellence)!!!! 	2
I will recommend Dr. Fu to everyone.  My experience was excellent.  The Office Staff were very welcoming and the wait time was minimal.  I felt very at ease with Dr. Fu, she listened to my questions and concerns, she understands.  Dr. Fu discussed my options with every issue, she talked to me, not at me.  Dr. Fu spent all the time I needed, I never once felt rushed.  I highly recommend her and her office.	2
Dr. Fu has been my Doctor for several years.  She is bright, thorough, exceptionally competent and provides excellent care.  She carefully listens and never rushes through appointments. I feel very privileged to have her on my health care team.	2
Hands down the best doctor I have seen in a long time.  Every where else I went either didnt care and certainly didn't take the time to try and pretend they did. Dr. Fu listened and instantly had a plan of action.  I left her office feeling like finally I am going to get back to normal thanks to her.	2
I hadn't been to a gynecologist in years.  I was nervous, embarrassed, and afraid.  I immediately felt a little more at ease by her friendly staff.  When I met Dr. Fu her whole demeanour made me so comfortable with her I wasn't embarrassed at all and was able to openly discuss my concerns.  She came up with a great plan of action for my needs and I feel I've found my Gynecologist for all my future concerns and annual exams.  I'm so glad I found Dr. Fu & West Valley OBGYN.	2
"Dr Fu is the best ! She’s   very professional and very helpful! The best doctor  in the world! 
"	2
Dr. Fu is very nice and understanding Doctor. I enjoy visiting with her. She is very professional, and at the same time very personal. 	2
Dr. Fu is amazing, she makes you feel comfortable and at ease. She answers all of your questions in your visit before you even ask them. If you do have questions she answers them completely. I would highly recommend her.	2
Dr. Fu cares about you as a person,  not just a patient. She takes the time to answer any questions or concerns you have and even if you don’t see her until a year later she will ask about them. ( She takes good notes.)	2
 Dr. Fu  presents as genuine and caring.  She takes the time to listen and makes well thought out recommendations. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to get into Dr. Fu,  however, I believe this is an indicator of what an excellent practitioner she is.  	2
Dr. Fu was great at explaining everything in terms I could understand! She didn't treat me as another number but as an actual patient! I would highly recommend Dr. Fu for OB care!	2
I greatly appreciate Dr. Fu taking time to talk with me and explain things in a way I understand.   	2
I am extremely satisfied with Dr. Fu! She is caring, down to earth and always makes the dreaded annual exam fast and painless. I trust her completely to help me through any problems I may have.  I always feel welcome and comfortable in their offices.	2
Dr. Fu delivered my 3rd child 2 years ago. This was also my 3rd c-section. She is very sweet and cares. She listens to your concerns, always has a smile and I never felt rushed. I would definetly recommend her. 	2
Dr. Fu is incredibly personable and puts me at ease with all my heath care questions and issues.  	2
"If you want to be berated to tears in the private confines of his exam room alone with him when you're ill and seeking care then he's the ""doctor"" for you!  Disturbing that he has a license to practice."	0
A very kind and compassionate doctor.  Took time to make sure I understood everything. 	2
Dr Gibbs delivered my youngest son 26 years ago and has been my gyn ever since.  He is very compassionate and caring with his patients. My kids always heard so many good things about him that my oldest son's daughter was delivered by him! 	2
Dr. Gibbs is a great Dr. I transferred to him because he accepts high-risk pregnancies and I was going to a reproductive endocrinologist for infertility.  Dr. Gibbs is very thorough and spends ample time making sure all your questions are answered. I have endometriosis and he treats me for that as well. I believe he genuinely cares for all his patients.  I highly recommend him. 	2
I've been with Dr. Gibbs for over 25 years and I am very pleased with his care!	2
I've been with Dr. Gibbs for 26 years and find him to be the best, trusted doc I have. Without exception he spends the time needed to listen and discuss problems and solutions, and is great at involving me in treatment decisions. I'd give him 10 stars if I could.	2
Intelligent, experienced, well-formed scientifically & competent medically. Listens well to patients.	2
I can't thank Dr. Gibbs enough for his help with my problem.  Three months of vaginal burning and one visit to him and his suggestion helped immediately.  He is a real God send to all women.  He is very caring and gives details so we understand our problem and he comes up with answers that help immensely.  I wish all doctors were as good as Dr. Gibbs.	2
The receptionist in this office has been very rude to me from the beginning. Not to mention, I was 15 min late due to circumstances beyond my control , drove an hour to get there, and they canceled my appointment because I was late. Very rude, in my opinion. The least they could do was squeeze me in. I have never had that happen at any other doctor I've ever been to. Melanie is wonderful, but I may just stop going due to their stringent office rules.	0
The visit was good not long waiting. Everyone is friendly and willing to help Dr. Cohen come in and talk with you to see how she may better assist your needs. She even gives her diagnoses and proceed with what is best for you. She is a very good doctor and I would recommend her to all women.	2
Dr. Cohan has been my doctor for 15 plus years!  She’s amazing and easy to talk to!  Love her?	2
Dr. Cohan has been my doctor for over 25 years, that alone should speak volumes.  She cares about her patients, taking time to ask about family, kids, etc.  she delivered both my kids so it’s nice to have that connection.  I highly recommend her to anyone looking for an OBGYN! 	2
Dr. Leslie Cohan is a doctor every woman should have as their OBY/GYN contact.  I came to Dr. Cohan because my general doctor could not correctly diagnose a problem. Dr. Cohen immediately recognized the problem, provided tempory safe relieve so as to eliminate further damage & connected me with a specialist. She is a very intelligent & compassionate woman! Her staff is personable & accommodating to their patients.	2
"I like that I feel so confident with the open attitude of Dr Cohan.
I am not just ""an appointment""
She has pictures of her family near the examination rooms and will comment if she has a same situation as I do. I feel I have her professional expertise and personal experience from which to draw. 
The staff is excellent and friendly. It is a good experience to go to the doctor, in her office."	2

It is great to have a physician that cares and looks out for you.  It will be a sad day when she is no longer in practice.	2
Dr. Leslie Cohan has been my OBGYN since 1988. She is an incredible physician and a remarkable person. She delivered two of our children, who are close in age to her own children, so we share family stories at every visit. She is very patient, professional and truly cares about her patients. Her staff is very pleasant and attentive. I have recommended people to her in the past and they really  like her. I highly recommend Dr. Cohan to anyone looking for an OBGYN. 	2

Dr. Cohan has been my doctor for 15 plus years. She always has time for your questions. Great bedside manner. Would and have recommended her to my family and friends. 	2
Dr Cohan is amazing. I highly recommend her!!	2
Dr Cohan is a great person and a good doctor. However, I think she should stick to ob/gyn. She circumcised my son and it was so poorly done he had to have surgery at 3 months old to fix it. When we complained about the job she did, she tells us it is common in 1% of cases, and I say that is unacceptable. My son did not grow extra skin from initial circumcision. If it was done right, then we wouldn't need a surgeon to cut off the extra hanging skin. DO NOT let her circumcise your kid	2
Love this office!!! I have been seeing Dr. Cohan for over 20 years!!! Everyone in the office is so professional.  I left for about a year (due to insurance change) and saw 3 doctors during that time.  I am glad our insurance changed again so that I can return to Dr. Cohan. 	2

I had to find a new ob after 18 years due to my provider falling out of my insurance plan's network.  Dr. Cohan's and her staff welcomed me with open arms.  On my first visit, they made me feel as if I had been a patient for years.  Very friendly, eager to help and the atmosphere is so inviting. The kicker is, I was fit into the schedule and there was no wait time.  I am so glad, my ob is no longer in the network because I would have never had this experience to share. I wholeheartedly recommend	2

All I have is great appreciation towards Dr. Novac and his Family.	2

Dr. Birman was recommended by another Ob-gyn....upon meeting him the first time he was very personable and took a good 40 minutes to talk to me and listen to my concerns. By the time I met with him I knew what I wanted to do and after looking at my detailed medical records he agreed with my choice of action. I had surgery almost a week ago and so far healing well after following his orders. I would highly recommend him. 	2
This doctor is a most horrible person that could be. My pregnant wife mistakenly parked in his parking space but he made her cry.	0

Congratulations Dr. Alex Birman to you and your team and thank you for your work	2
Dr.Birman provided the best care for me. He delivered my daughter a week ago. Everything went quick and painless, I recovered within minutes due to his professional medical approach to labor. Thank you Dr. Birman for this life changing event. Can't wait to come see you for baby number 2 :)	2
I went to Dr. Birman for the 1st time. Within 5 minutes of meeting me, he recommended surgery. I was there for an annual. He is money hungry. He scoffed at my insurance and made me feel uncomfortable. Not to mention his exam was a bit painful. I have never felt so unhappy after a routine exam! Next time I will pay full price for Dr. Shatz or go back to my original insurance.  The garbage was overflowing which was quite disgusting.	0
Dr. Birman was great! His level of professionalism and effiecny made me feel extremely comfortable during my visit. He was able to answer all my questions.

Dr. Buck is AMAZING. She has the best bedside manners and treats her patients like family. I stumbled upon her accidentally as I intended to go to another OB in the same building but wound up in the wrong office (hers) and I couldn't be happier I did. She deserves 10 stars!	2

"Dr. Rhee is amazing! She really takes the time to listen to your concerns. She would always tell me to call her no matter how small or ridiculous I thought the problem was. I have three children and Dr Rhee delivered my last one and she is hands down the best. She genuinely cares about her patients. I’ve never had to wait long and I’ve never felt rushed. I drove out of state just so she could be my Dr and delivery my baby. 
Thank you for everything Dr Rhee!"	2
Part of the reason I saw the doctor was addressed.  It seemed she was rushed to leave before other concerns were addressed.  I left feeling my concerns were minimized.. I do not see an OBGYN often so I was hoping to have my concerns addressed. Disappointed.	0
Dr. Rhee is a wonderful doctor and I immediately felt comfortable with her the moment she walked in the room and I met her. Glad I chose her as my OB!	2
I was reluctant, as usual, to make my annual appointment especially because my previous doctor retired and I just generally don't like medical appointments. However, I was immediately comfortable when Dr Rhee walked into the room and began to talk to me. I think she's fantastic. I won't hesitate to go to my appointments on time from here on. Thank you Dr. Rhee for making me comfortable.	2
She is an amazing doctor she was so patient with me when i was going threw my menopause i was so miserable but she stuck with me and got me threw it she is a godsend. I thought my husband was just as miserable as i was. I really felt sorry for him but he took it with a grain of salt	2
I absolutely adore Dr Rhee and her office staff. I am a new patient at her office and have Dr Rhee has truly been a God send to me and my husband. We haven't had the best of luck having successful pregnancies, but I'm confident that we will have more luck in the future under Dr Rhee's care and guidance. I would recommend her and her staff to anyone!!	2
She is an awesome Doctor!!	2
When I delivered my baby, my Dr was not on call. Dr. Rhee was and I met my match!! She was fantastic from the second she walked into my triage room to and through my delivery. I could not have asked for a better doctor. She is kind, caring, intelligent and has the best laugh around. Hands down, the best OB in town!!!	2
The best doctor you can imagine.  Kind, caring, and excellent at her job.  I can't imagine delivering my boys without her. 	2
Dr. Rhee is a companionate Doctor. She always puts her patients needs first and goes out of her way to make then comfortable. We love her! 	2
0 star if I could. As a patients we pay these doctors to have 0 issues during the pregnancy and the at delivery. Because they monitor everything and knows everything about their patients. Well, mine did not go that great, end up with 4th degree tear( never been told about it  after delivery. So end up in ER week later with lots of pain and that's when I was told about bad tear ) followed by ileostomy. Basically I have been living the hell last 9 months. You took away my happiness dr Rhee. 	0
Such a great personality.  Kind.  Caring.  Very easy to talk to and very through.  I have suggested her to other friends AND family.  	2
The best obgyn ever! She is amazing and so caring and gentle. 	2
Dr. Otoole is very loving and caring. She always make us feel comfortable. She is very concerned about our health. I would recommend her for my friends and family. Anyone would be glad to receive such selfless love from her especially during pregnancy. 	2
Dr. O'Toole is the best doctor I have had in my entire life. I trust her implicitly. She is gentle, an outstanding listener and always calm no matter what is going on.  She has gone the extra mile for me numerous times in caring for me before my pregnancies as well as through both complicated high risk pregnancies and now heading into menopause. She always responds to my emails personally and calls me personally with test results. Her attitude is positive and encouraging on every issue and conce	2
I had really bad experience with Dr.Otoole. This OB is very fake in giving me hugs, but she cannot help anything as a professional. She does not have knowledge or skill to be a doctor at all. It was really a bad luck for me to choose her as my doctor, i was taking a BIG risk in only hoping I needed be 100% healthy during pregnancy so I would not be cared by her since she could not. She give no useful advises and when I had any complicacy, she only care and protect herself by giving no treatment.	0
Being pregnant with my second child and having had a different OBGYN with my first that I was extremely happy with,  I was worried about finding a new doctor. Dr. Khan was excellent in my opinion, thorougher, clear and direct. All great qualities I  look for in my healthcare providers. I never felt rushed in appointments but they were generally quick which I appreciated. Only one longer wait due to a birth. Perfectly understandable. I was told as soon as they were aware of the delay. :)	2
Dr. Khan took great care of me and my daughter through the course of a high-risk pregnancy with multiple complications. She successfully turned my baby from breach to head-down, and I was so ecstatic to avoid a c-section. Dr. Khan is TOP NOTCH!	2
Dr. Khan was kind and patient as she explained the procedures and answered my questions. You can tell she truly cares about her patients.	2
I loved having Dr. Khan as my OB.  She was very attentive to my concerns and answered questions thoughtfully.  She truly cares about her patients. 	2
She took a lot of time and explained everything in a easy to understand way.  My surgery went beautifully and I couldn't be happier.	2
I was with Dr. Becker for 13 years until my insurance changed.  I absolutely recommend her to anyone that is looking for a knowledgeable, trustworthy and friendly OB/GYN doctor.  She has an awesome bedside manner and truly cares about her patients.	2
Dr. Lane is an amazing doctor and I have seen her on several occasions. As someone who has pretty major health anxiety it is very important to me that my concerns aren't simply dismissed. Dr. Lane really listens and takes the time to thoroughly explain all procedures and lab results in a reassuring tone. I have never felt rushed during an appointment and I have always felt my worries greatly reduced rather than aggravated when I have a visit with her. I highly recommend Dr. Lane and the great staff at this practice.	2
"Dr. Lane has been my provider for many years.  She is the best.  She is very personable and puts patients at ease.  I have had a couple of health ""speed bumps"" over the past 5 years, and she has been with me every step of the way."	2
I have been seeing Dr. Lane for the last six years. She and her staff have always provided the highest quality of care. Dr. Lane is extremely thorough, attentive and personable.  She is truly sensitive to her patient's needs.  I cannot recommend her highly enough!!!	2
Dr. Lane is awesome. She helped me when I was having health issues and had a very rough 2 years before I went to her. Dr. Lane found the problem and after my procedure I am finally back to my old self. She always listens to what I have to say and makes you feel very comfortable. I love her so much I recommended her  to my daughter in law and Dr. Lane also delivered my granddaughter. She was great during my daughter in laws pregnancy and delivery. I highly recommend her. 	2
Dr. Lane is so personable. I feel very comfortable discussing any health issues I have. I would (and have) definitely refer her to anyone looking for such a trusted physician.	2
Lara Lane is the best OB GYN I have ever seen. She is kind caring compassionate, she listens to me and is genuinely concerned about me as her patient.I am very fortunate to have found her. 	2
Dr Lane is a very kind and knowledgeable doctor. I never have to wait very long and they are always so kind and caring when I come in. Linda, at the front desk, is always welcoming and on the one occasion I was running late she was so kind to me. I called to tell them I was running late and they helped me out and were so kind about it all! As soon as I came in Linda assured me all was well! Linda is also very good at explaining all billing and making sure everything is exactly right!!	2
Great experience with Dr Lane and her staff. Took her time to get to know me and and answered my questions well. Great bedside manner. 	2
I adore Dr. Lane. She takes excellent care of me, and has from college all the way to the birth of my son. 	2
I highly recommend Dr. Lane and her staff. They are all extremely knowledgeable, very professional, very friendly. 	2
"Going to a new Dr. Is always nerve racking.   I've had my other gyno for about 25 years
From the moment I called the office I felt at ease.  Everyone in the office was very pleasant.  From 
The nurse taking my vitals to seeing the Dr. I never felt rushed and they made me feel less nervous.
"	2
Dr. Lane is not only an excellent physician she is an exceptional individual!  She spends quality time with you and cares about you as a person as well as your family life.  I would highly recommend her to anyone of any age.  	2
Dr. Lane is an incredible physician! She really takes her time to get to know you and ask you questions regarding your visit.  	2
I have been going to Dr. Lane for all of my OBGYN needs for over 9 years. I have never had a bad experience and appreciate her friendliness, compassion, knowledge and overall experience. 	2
I am so happy with my experience with Dr. Lane.  The office staff was helpful and cheerful, and I felt like my wait time was reasonable.  Dr. Lane didn't seem rushed, spent a lot of time with me, and what I really love about her is that she doesn't get freaked out about things.  Very reassuring and friendly!	2
"Love her.  Practice is great - administration and nurses are responsive and understanding and helpful.  Dr Lane is patient, down to earth, easy to talk to, and by far the best OBGYN I've had the ""pleasure"" of seeing.  Highly recommend Dr Lane and Women's Care of Colorado."	2
After a number of years with another practice, I decided to switch to a physician that was closer to my home.  After spending time online searching for an alternative, I was fortunate to find Dr. Lara Lane with Women's Care of Colorado.  Dr. Lane and her staff more than met my expectations and I am very happy with my decision!	2
I have been seeing Dr.Lane for many years.  She is very professional and personable as well.  I feel comfortable talking to her about anything and she always listens and is never in a rush.  Very pleasant always!  Highly recommended.	2
"Dr. Lane is fantastic!!! I have always felt so comfortable with her and she is very professional! When we had our daughter, complications lead to an emergency C section. I was terrified but Dr. Lane was calm and explained what was happening and why this was going to be the best choice for me and my baby. I trust her completely and will keep her as my OB/GYN for as long as she is practicing! You will not find a better doctor anywhere!!!
"	2
Dr. Lane and the staff that work in the office are extremely courteous and professional. Dr. Lane takes the time to answer any questions you may have and doesn't sugar coat her answers which I really appreciate. I've had a great experience with the team thus far and would certainly recommend her for your OBGYN needs. 	2
"I saw Dr. Lane for the first time a few weeks ago.  From the time I called to schedule a ""new patient"" appointment (was able to get in the same day), until the time I left the office, I was treated respectfully and as an individual (versus a number) by the entire staff.  Dr. Lane took the time to go over my medical history in detail and was professional, knowledgeable and extremely friendly.  I highly recommend this practice!"	2
I've been a patient for 15 years. Dr. Lane delivered my children and has been a fantastic health care partner. Wouldn't want any other OB/GYN	2
"In an era where ""exceptional"" one to one patient service excellence has virtually disappeared from this industry, I feel compelled to write a comment on behalf of Dr. Cowan and staff.  Dr. Cowan is one of the most amazing human being I have ever met.  She is very professional, caring and sensitive to her patients needs.  Her staff always go the extra mile to help and accommodate their schedules."	2
I have been one of Dr. Cowan's patients for approximately 30 years.  At each and every appointment, she takes her time and actually listens to your questions or concerns.  One example is when I told her I was experiencing high abdominal pain.  She said that sounded as if i had a gall bladder issue and referred me to a surgeon for tests.  Sure enough, that was exactly what was wrong.  I see Dr. Cowan for a Well Woman check-up each year and will continue to do so as long as she is practicing.	2
Dr. Cowan has been my gynecologist for almost 25 years, and she gets better every year! I barely completed my paperwork when I was shown to the exam room, and had barely changed when Dr. Cowan arrived for my annual well-woman exam.  She is always warm and considerate, and the consummate professional.   I was very fortunate 12 years ago when she identified uterine cancer at an extremely early stage, and will always be grateful to her for saving my life.  She is the best and I highly recommend her!	2
I’ve been going to her for 30 yrs. She’s seen me through a lot of health issues and every time has told me that she would be with me every step of the way. And she was. I presently live in Austin but make the trip to Houston because I refuse to see anyone else and she’s worth it! Most caring and compassionate doctor I’ve ever been to. I’ve referred her to my friends and every one of them, without exception, loves her. You will not regret having her as your doctor.	2
I would overwhelmingly recommend Dr.Cowan because of her attention to details concerning your health care. She listens and spends quality time with you. Her office staff are very professional and friendly! If you need to speak with her nurse, she will contact you within 24 hours.	2
"Wonderful doctor and great staff.
Dr. Cowan cares about her patients and listens to her patients. I’m so happy to have been given Dr. Cowan’s name from a friend of mine. I know a few friends that see Dr. Cowan. Excellent doctor and staff."	2
I have used Dr. Cowan for more than 20 years I am very satisfied with her professionalism to her patients.	2
Dr Cowan is a very compassionate doctor. She even follows up with her patients. 	2
I have been using Dr. Cowan for about 20-25 years... she is very professional and kind. She serves both the young and pregnant as well as those of who us who just need her gynecological services. She's great!	2
Dr. Cowan is awesome. She takes plenty of time and really listens.	2
Dr Cowan is a very caring individual.  She asked many questions during the appointment and not afraid to spend time with the patients. I have seen Dr Cowan for more than 30 years.	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Cowan for a short time but I love her caring demeanor.   	2
"Dr Cowan has been my doctor for 30 years.
You will fall in love with her and her staff!"	2
Dr. Cowan listens closely to me when I am talking and never is in a hurry. She is a delight!!	2
Dr. Cowan goes above and beyond her responsibilities.  She is a caring healthcare provider.  In her practice you are not rushed when seeing her.  She cares about her patients overall concerns.  She makes me feel like family.  	2
Dr. Cowan and her staff are amazing!! They treat their parents as family and in today’s world that is very hard to find! I would never go anywhere else!	2
I’ve been a patient Dr. Cawans for 26 years. I’ve recommended mothers in the past and they love her. My daughter that she delivered has been going to her as well for the last 5 yrs and now flies in from Arizona for her yearly well women. Appts all but never get rescheduled due to births and the staff has been working for her at least 10+ years. Dr. Cowan is personable and takes the time needed to listen to your concerns. Make your appt now. You won’t be sorry. 	2
Caring and thoughtful physician. She is open to discussions about health care and wellness. You never feel rushed. 	2
I travel  from over an hour and a half  to have her treat me.  She is so caring, informative, and a good listener. 	2
I have been a patient of Dr Cowan’s for many years and can’t say enough good things about her! She is caring and compassionate. She has incredible bedside manor. She is not quick to jump to surgeries or pharmaceuticals, but when she does, she explores your options and is very thorough. You can talk to her like she’s a friend...and after all these years, she feels like a friend! In a world of ever changing healthcare, you’re in good hands with Dr Cowan.	2
Dr. Cowan is the most attentive and knowledgeable doctor I have ever had. The comfort level is beyond perfect and the medical services she provides are above my and my families expectations. She has cared for all the women in my family from many generations. We love her! And you will too. 	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Cowan many years.  Over the years, I have found Dr. Cowan to be courteous, professional, competent, and patient.  I have had no bad experiences with her medical services and advice.  She takes the time to handle a patient's concerns and is very thorough in the exam and in her questions.	2
Dr. Cowan has a very caring and professional bedside manner.  She listens to any questions and/or concerns.  She doesn’t ever make you feel rushed.   	2
I would recommend ANYONE to Dr. Cowan!! She is a God-send!! She has been nothing but caring and nurturing during each appointment. She has been my Obgyn since I was 16 years old, and I am now 47! Thank you, Dr. Cowan for being the BEST doctor I've ever had!	2
Dr. Cowan is a knowledgeable doctor in her field, but is also very personable. She gives me her attention and concern about my health, but also what is going on in my personal life. She is genuine and caring. I always tell people about her when they ask about who would be a good OB-GYN.  	2
Dr. Cowan is a wonderful doctor and treats patients well.  However, you should be prepared to spend a good amount of time waiting for your appointment because she does give personal attention to everyone (which is great) but does not book appointments accordingly (the appointments are booked too close together considering the length of time she spends with each patient). 9 times out of 10 I'd wait more than an hour for my appointment and I'd be one of the first ones of the day. 	2
Dr. Cowan takes the time to visit with you.   She is excellent at what she does and she has a calm reassuring tone.  	2
"Dr. Cowan is the best gyno around.  She makes you feel very comfortable and takes the time to talk to you and/or answer any questions or concerns you may have.  

I highly recommend her to anyone and hope and pray she stays in practice forever.  "	2
Dr Cowan takes time to discuss any questions or concerns.  The entire staff is very responsive and helpful.  I have complete trust in Dr Cowan. 	2
"I would highly recommend Dr. Cowan to anyone looking for an OB/Gyn.  She's warm and personable. I've been seeing her since the late 90's and she still remembers delivering my 2 boys.  
I never feel like I'm being rushed out - like I'm on a time limit - when speaking with her about any concerns I may have. She makes sure to ask if I have any other questions about anything before I leave.  Her staff is helpful and friendly. She must run a happy office because her staff has remained constant."	2
"I started seeing Dr. Cowan when I was 18 years old and now am 42 with two children. Her care has been exceptional and the staff is caring and professional. I have had some long waits in the waiting room, but  know that I will receive just as much attention and do not mind the wait.

"	2
She delivered my daughter and will now be delivering my son. She is a wonderful doctor with amazing bedside manor and I would recommend her to anyone! 	2
With Dr. Cowan I felt comfortable putting my feet on those sock covered stirrups. for the first time ever.. I'm 60 years old and I've seen many gynos. over the years - Dr. Cowan chats before doing the exam which puts me at ease. Then when you lay back there's a poster of a handsome actor on the ceiing. You never know who you're going to see because she has a different one in each room., which makes the visit fun. When was the last time you can say you had a giggle at the gyno? 5 stars all around	2
Dr. Cowan is extremely knowledgeable, intuitive, and holistic in her approach to medicine.  She builds a relationship with her patients by listening and genuinely getting to know them.  She is an outstanding physician.  	2
"Terrible, disrespectful, unprofessional front desk staff and office manager. They show no concern for patient needs. After 4 months of waiting for an appointment the office manager discussed our case in front of everyone, mocked us saying ""we do not do meet and greats"", was extremely rude and showed us out of the door without ever seeing the doctor. They only care about pushing people through with no consideration for patient situation or reasons to come to see the doctor. Don't come here."	0
Dr. Cowan is an excellent doctor.  She knows her patients and makes time for them. She listens well, and asks good questions.  I have never felt rushed, and her suggestions and diagnosis have been spot on.  Her staff has been great too; professional, helpful and excellent follow.  They do a nice job minimizing the wait times too.	2
Dr. Cowan is the BEST!  She is kind & compassionate, always taking the time to listen to any concerns I have and works to find a solution.  Dr. Cowan and her staff are like family.  Love them all!	2
I wonted to book an appointment as a new patient, the front disk was so rude and calculate the expected date wrong and was latterly shouting through phone.. If she will deal with new patient like that imagine if Istarted follow up with them .. canceled the appointment rude staff 	0
Dr. Cowan is an amazing doctor.  She is also caring and always has time to answer your questions.  She delivered my son 14 years ago and I am honored that she is still my gynecologist. 	2
Dr. Cowan is a fantastic doctor. She delivered my second child. With her vast experience, she is thorough with her examination and explanations to her patients.  I have been a patient of Dr. Cowan for more than 20 years, and I plan to stay a patient as long as I can. 	2
"Dr. Cowan treats me like I am her only patient. She is kind and takes her time explaining things and making sure I am comfortable with the plan for my health. Very honest and upfront but very caring in the delivery of her medical opinions. 
Skilled and knowledgable beyond measure. "	2
Dr. Cowan is wonderful .  She has been my doctor for over 25 years.  She takes time to talk with you and answer questions you may have. Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable.  I would recommend her highly.	2
Dr. Cowan is a compassionate physician who takes patient care seriously.  I have a health issue that makes pregnancy complicated.  Dr. Cowan worked patiently with me through the years, to ensure my body finally got to a healthy state, where pregnancy was a viable option.  I am thrilled to note at the time of this review, I am 8 months pregnant!  Dr. Cowan works extremely hard to make her patient's health goals a success.  I am extremely grateful for her empathetic, and outstanding care.  	2
"she is so nice and so patient
i feel comfortable and happy for the whole progress"	2
Amazing doctor he goes the extra mile . He makes sure you understand . Takes his time with you . He's very caring .	2
Fabulous doctor! 	2
Grolle is AMAZING! Having had experiences in countless doctors offices for serious conditions since I was about 4, I can be pretty anxious about the care I get (I've seen ALL types). This man is very caring, considerate, patient & understanding. 10/10 likely the best Dr I've ever had, he takes the time to explain things & does his best to make you feel comfortable. The office (& friendly, helpful staff!) itself is very calming & so many patients will actually be smiling in the waiting room. 	2
Very respectful doctor explains and answers all questions came to him for my pregnancy. 	2
"From my very first visit Dr. Ensley and his staff have been nothing short of amazing! They are very Kind, and make you feel comfortable at each appointment you come to. It really takes special people to be in this profession and I am happy they took care of me and my son. I will miss Dr. E and his staff when we have to move. I would recommend them to anyone!	"	2
"I am very pleased with Dr. Ensley and his staff. I came here due to female pain. I immediately felt comfortable. Dr. Ensley is genuinely concerned with his patients.	"	2
"Always friendly always professional very trustworthy	"	2
Dr. Ensley and his staff are amazing. Very caring and knowledgeable	2
Amazing caring physician. He always shows such empathy towards whatever emotion Im feeling after a recent hysterectomy at a young age. He was always very forth coming and honest with my treatment and his abilities. I have never met such a great doctor before in all honesty...That really CARES for his patients, their wellbeing and listens! Im so glad I found him a few years ago for a 2nd opinion. I have referred my sister and cousin to him as well and they also adore him and his abilities!!	2
Dr. Ensley is an awesome Dr! I tell everyone how thorough he has always been, recommend him all the time, my gyn 9yrs+. Seriously,  it's so refreshing to have a Dr who actually listens....the hard part is actually asking questions, but that's not his fault, he doesn't rush you! I'm 1 week post-op full hysterectomy laparoscopic surgery, he did an excellent job, everything seems to be healing nicely. He called my husband back when he was concerned about how sick I was on day 3 post-op. Love him!	2
"Dr. Ensley is FANTASIC!! I can't say enough about how wonderful our experiences have been with our two pregnancies. We highly recommend Dr. Ensley!!!	"	2
"Excellent experience!!!! Very friendly staff.	"	2
Dr. Ensley is great. He took excellent care of me and my rainbow baby. He was patient and empathetic. And his staff is phenomenal. 	2
"Wonderful Doctor and team. Highly recommend. He has delivered all my children and it has been a wonderful experience!	"	2
"Had a great prenatal experience with all office staff. They are all very helpful and kind. I love the small office, I was able to make relationships with each of them. I would highly recommend coming to this office!	"	2
"Amazing listener, attentive to your needs and expectations of a physician. 
Went to Dr. Ensley for a second opinion and have now made him my new GYN. 
Thanks Dr. E! "	2
Dr. Ensley is a great OBGYN! My husband and I went to him as we were planning our pregnancy. Durning our consultation visit he was a great listener! He knew exactly what direction to point us in. A month later I was expecting! Through out my entire pregnancy he was great listener, answered all our questions, gave me excellent care! He delivered our healthy baby girl!  His staff is friendly & polite. I would definitely recommend him to a friend! Sincerely, The Gathers...	2
He is the best!! He takes his time with you and listens to everything you have to say!!  I recommend him to everybody!! 	2
First met Dr. Ensley 4 years ago and haven't looked back. He delivered all three of our kids. My wife and I would never consider another OB. He is personable, made us feel like we were the only thing he was worried about when he was in the room. His humor and personality are complimentary and delivered in appropriate amounts. His expertise is undisputed. Loved Dr. Ensley	2
Best OBGYN you'll ever have!  I absolutely LOVE going to see Dr. Ensley and his staff.  Dr. Ensley actually delivered all three of our kids.  I got pregnant with our third child when my husband and I were stationed somewhere else and then I moved back to Indiana at the end of my second trimester when my husband deployed to not only be closer to family, but also for myself and baby to be in the good hands of Dr. Ensley.  Although this was my third pregnancy, it was my first without my husband whi	2
Dr. Ensley is the best! He is extremely caring, knowledgeable, sensitive to your feelings, goes out of his way to do what he can to help with whatever issue you may be having. He did my hysterectomy years ago, and did an awesome job! When I had any problems after the surgery, I paged him, and he responded immediately, even from a wedding he was at. Now that is dedication to patients! He is very reliable and responsive. Love him!!	2
Dr. Patwardhan is an amazing doctor.  She meets all the checkpoints, and I should know, I'm a surgeon also.  She took my wife through a very difficult pregnancy and was with us every step of the way.  There was great communication with the office and easy scheduling.  It ultimately came down to a c-section...turns out she is an outstanding surgeon too!   Highly recommend her and her practice.  	2
Annual check up always an easy comfortable experience with Dr Feore.	2
As always, for the past 31 years to be exact, I had a great doctor appointment.  My most recent visit went well even with a change in where my mamo was scheduled.  I was advised ahead of time that the location of my appointment had changed since my last visit.  It was on the 2nd floor as opposed to being in the same office with Dr. Feore.  I was greeted promptly and my wait was brief.  Once done with the mamo, I headed upstairs for my annual visit and again, check in was quick and my wait was very brief, and I was early.  Everyone was a pleasure that assisted with my appointment on this day.  I have been going to Dr. Feore since I was 18 years old.  I highly recommend him!	2
When I first went to Dr. Feore I had already had 2 miscarriages.  He was so understanding and assured me I had every option to have a successful pregnancy.  That was 35 years ago and I have 3 amazing children 34, 32, & 29 and 3 beautiful grandbabies.  He is very thorough and is truly interested in all aspects of your health and life.  I would not trust my gyn needs to anyone else.	2
Everyone is so professional yet personable. 	2
Always takes time to listen, never feel rushed!  Been a patient got over 30 years	1
"I've been going to Dr. Feore for many years. He delivered 2 of my children. 
He is a caring doctor who listens to his patients. "	2
I'VE BEEN SEEING DR FEORE FOR YEARS NOW AND I JUST LOVE HIM.  HE TAKES HIS TIME TO TALK TO YOU CONCERNING YOUR HEALTH AND ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS YOU MAY HAVE.   HE ALWAYS MAKES ME SMILE TOO.  THE STAFF IS ALWAYS VERY FRIENDLY AND KIND.	2
Dr. Feore is always very compassionate and helpful.  He listens and offers advice when asked.  I recommend him highly!	2
I always love my annual visit with Dr. Feore.  Everyone in the lovely office is pleasant and professional.  I never have to wait long.  I enjoy the time Dr. Feore spends with me in his office before going into the exam room.  I especially like that I can have my mammogram done in the office.  This year I was scheduled for the mammogram immediately following my office exam.  Only one trip necessary.  The  mammogram technician was upbeat and funny and made that experience go quickly.	2
Dr. Feore is one of the BEST doctors I have had.  He listens and he cares.  Dr. Feore will take care of you whatever your needs are.	2
Dr Feore always listens! He is open to discuss any GYN topic, and this doc knows his stuff. Professional, courteous, knowledgeable. I want to come back to “he listens”...actually pays attention to his patients, and that is a rare quality. Proud to say I’m his patient.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Feore's since I was 18 or 19 years old - I feel as though he is a very trusted friend, not just my gynecologist.  I have trusted his review of my concerns, questions, etc., all of this time-he listens, explains and offers options.  I have recommended him to others and will continue to do so for as long as he is practicing!!  It is so easy to schedule an appointment - staff are always willing to assist.  Staff are so friendly, courteous, and caring.  	2
I have been seeing Dr Feore for 20 years he delivered all six of my children, he takes time to listen and is the most caring doctor you could ever have. Dr Feore is wonderful I am very grateful to have him as my doctor you will never find anyone like him!!!!!	2
This doctor appears to be very knowledgeable about his areas of expertise. I had a terrible experience with him that made me feel awkward, disrespected and looked down upon. I believe this man has an inferior complex. 	0
I have been a patient of Dr. Feore's for over 30 years and he is one of my all-time favorite doctors.  I wish he could be my family doctor.  Not only has he checked on my gynecological health over the years, but he also checks to make sure I am taking care of my health in all areas—weight, blood pressure, vaccines, colonoscopies, etc.  Plus, I can tell that he actually reads my chart and pays attention to changes.	2
Dr. Feore has been my OBGYN for decades.  He is a compassionate, dedicated, caring, and knowledgeable physician, who I recommend to others.	2
Dr. Feore and his nurse are the best team I've ever had. I went to other doctors for a problem and was repeatedly told my symptoms were something to be ignored. Dr. Feore assured me he would look for everything he could and he did. He always explains exactly what's happening and answers all my questions no matter how many times I ask them. I trust them completely and will continue to go back to him for all my obgyn needs. 	2
Dr. Feore is AWESOME! He is a very knowledgeable and personable doctor. I feel welcomed and known at every appointment. His staff is excellent too! 	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Feore to everyone.  I am 56 years old and he has been my doctor since I was 23 years old.  He has always been kind and thorough.  I think he goes above and beyond for his patients.  	2
Excellent care	2
Dr. Feore is so easy to talk to about any topic. He listens carefully and is alert to other health issues that may be affecting you. He safely delivered both my sons. 	2
I have been seeing Dr. Feore for years. He has helped me with so many medical issues. I trust him completely with any recommendations he has suggested for me. He really is like family! The office staff is great too! Always a great experience going there for my visits!	2
I have been seeing Dr. Feore for over 32 years! He is by far the most awesome Doctor that you could ever choose with regards to your healthcare. He was my doctor through two pregnancies. Dr. Feore is professional, compassionate, concerned and genuinely cares about his patients and their families. He always makes you feel like you are the only patient of the day. He takes time to talk to you, listen to you and is very thorough in answering any questions. He is family <3  	2
Dr. Feore is knowledgeable, kind, and compassionate. You have his total attention during your visit. Dr. Feore takes the time to explain test results and treatment options. 	2
Dr Feore is amazing, he's very down to earth and willing to explain/talk through anything. He's got a great sense of humor and the hospital staff loves him... for us that spoke volumes about any Dr. We chose to see him for both of our babies and couldn't have felt more blessed	2
He so easy to talk to and offering help with women health issues I drive an 1 hour and 30 mins because He has my best interest and health in mind when I visit him	2
I've been seeing Dr. Feore for quite a few years and I highly recommend him. He's very professional, but also personal and compassionate. He and his staff do whatever is possible to keep my wait time the shortest possible, and I appreciate that. I trust Dr. Feore when he recommends something for me -- he always explains the options completely. I never feel rushed.	2
I've been with Dr Feore for over 15 years, since I was a young adult.  He's been there for all of the different women's health scenarios throughout the years including delivering my two beautiful daughters by csection.  He takes the time to listen to your concerns to provide guidance and address your medical needs. And he has a great since of humor...Love him, he's awesome!!!!!	2
"I HAVE BEEN SEEING DR. FEORE FOR ABOUT 30 YRS. ALWAYS BEEN GREAT CARE.MY DAUGHTER SEES HIM AS WELL.AND HE HAS DELIVERED 2 OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN.GREAT STAFF.
MICHELLE"	2
Dr. Feore was very informative and thorough. He did a procedure on me that very first visit and he walked me through it step by step. His staff was also very personable. I walked out of that office knowing that whatever the results may be from the procedure, I was in good hands. 	2
Dr. Feore is a fantastic doctor, he truly cares about his patients.  	2
I love Dr. Feore!!! He is such a great doctor. He really listens to you and truly cares about his patients. He delivered my little man back in August and really made it such a great experience. He has amazing bedside manner and really makes you feel at ease. His humor is the cherry on top. Pleaseeeee still be delivering babies in 3-4 years when we try for another!!! :)	2
I have had the pleasure of being a patient of Dr. Feore for many years and have been through many different experiences with him, as my doctor and now my daughter's doctor.  Through the experience of surgeries, procedures and babies, we have found him to be very knowledgeable and caring and very good at his job.  I consider him a friend and an exceptional doctor and would definitely recommend him to anyone who is searching for a good doctor.   	2
I always get Dr. Bevan's undivided attention when I am with her.  She asks good, probing questions and follows up as needed based on my answers and my history.  She is also proactive with respect to diagnostics given my family history of breast cancer.  Metropolitan OB/GYN as a practice is also very professional and courteous.  I would highly recommend the practice and Dr. Bevan	2
Though I love dr Bevan, the practice is horrible and we had to leave because of the staff.: my husband and I had some fertility tests done and no one would call us back with the results after over a week of waiting. Keep in mind that they have the results less than an hour after the sample is given (and which we paid out of pocket hundreds of dollars for) it’s been over a week and we are still waiting! I contacted the office on four occasions- each of which I Was put on hold for more than 10 minutes each time and had to provide a callback number. After reading other reviews on google, especially the woman who had a miscarriage and they kept calling her trying to schedule a third trimester appointment., I will be seeking other options. The office staff does not do things they say they will from our experience and we cannot trust them.	0
I have been seeing Dr. Bevan since 2012. She is one of a kind! Professional, smart, kind, gentle and compassionate. I have never felt rushed during a visit. She makes you feel like you are the only patient she is seeing that day! She listens to you and has such a gentle demeanor that instantly makes you feel comfortable. She has delivered both of my boys and each time has gone above and beyond to make sure we are all doing well! I love Dr. Bevan! 	2
A fantastic doctor, very patient and informative. She took the time to really understand my story and situation. I would highly recommend Dr Bevan 	2
Dr. Bevan was great at understanding my concerns and referring me to the right fertility doctor.  She listened attentively and offered suggestions along the way.  I just moved from NY so I was very happy to meet a great new doctor.	2
"Dr. Bevan is the best! When I lived in AZ for two years I flew back specifically to see her. She is amazing with her bedside manner, always listens and really cares about her patients. I look forward to working with her through any and all of my pregnancies. I’ve also seen a few other PA’s and Dr’s at the clinic and they have all been great.
Thanks!"	2
Dr. Bevan was so kind and gentle with me.  She is extremely knowledgeable and thoughtful with her questions.  I shared with her what my husband and I are going through with trying to get pregnant. She listened to my concerns and put me at ease. I highly recommend Dr. Bevan and will send my friends and family to her.  	2
Patient beware! If you go to her, just don't answer questions because she'll charge you for it. The appointment itself was fine; no wait time and Dr. Bevan was friendly. However, during my initial well-woman visit, she asked questions based on my intake form (matters covered per Metro OBGYN's policy), yet coded it as two separate items. Essentially because I answered the questions about my family history/birth control, it brought it outside a preventive exam and is now an out of pocket expense. 	0
Dr. Bevan goes beyond the typical treatment to make sure you are well and truly healthy. She goes through the normal steps, but reviews everything again to make sure she isn't missing anything and is giving you the best healthcare possible. I greatly enjoy her company and am so glad she is my doctor. I also appreciate the cleanliness and friendliness of the office, rooms, staff, and other providers. I feel very welcome when I visit metropolitan obgyn. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Visit metro!	2
Dr. Bevan was very attentive, sensitive, and knowledgeable.  I was very pleased with the level of treatment she gave me.	2
I'm a new client of Dr. Bevan's and have been very impressed with her. I feel comfortable talking with her so it's nice to find someone that I think will be a good fit for me for many years to come. 	2
 I have been going to metropolitan OB/GYN for 10 years. Dr Bevan is very professional and approachable. The staff, as well as the other doctors here, exhibit the same qualities.  The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed  and I would recommend this office to anyone looking for  high quality care. 	2
Knowledgeable, friendly, no-nonsense, on-time, great listener 	2
"Dr. Dalm is hands down the best doctor around! He has preformed two surgeries on me and the second one was an emergency due to 5.5 cm cyst - doctor dalm saved 1/3 of my ovary! Thanks to him I am confident I will be able to live my life without severe pain and one day be a mommy. He always is very kind and caring makes me feel like my needs are important and like I’m family. From 14 years old to 28 now I’ll always highly recommend and trust dr. Dalm for all my womanly needs! Thank you Dr. Dalm, Mary, Grace and Nisha - couldn’t be more thankful for all of you wonderful amazing individuals! 
Sincerely,
Andrea L"	2
My primary Dr. recommended Dr. Dalm to me when I was having a hard time getting pregnant. Dr. Dalm was fantastic from day one. It wasn't long before I had a diagnosis of endometriosis(I had been complaining of the symptoms of endo to my primary for YEARS) and polycystic ovary syndrome. After a few surgeries and a few procedures I had 2 healthy babies. Fas tforward and Dr. Dalm performed my hysterectomy. It was incredibly easy. He is the BEST	2
Dr. Dalm was the first out of 8 doctors to listen to me and give me treatment for endometriosis which I have been dealing with for 8 years prior to him. I am currently still a patient seeking treatment for infertility and he does his best. I do think seeing a specialist would be better as Dr. Dalm sometimes lacks clarity in his explanations and leaves out small details. All in all I’m beyond grateful that I finally have a diagnosis of endometriosis and have had some relief after my surgery. 	2
I have been going to Dr. a Dalm for the last two years. Him and his staff have been such a pleasure to work with. Grace, Amber, Olivia, and Sarah are amazing. When I walk in I just feel so welcomed, especially since they took the time to get to know me. Dr. Dalm and his staff are very informative, professional and very compassionate. I highly recommend him and will be going to him as long as he is working.	2
Dr Dalm and his staff are amazing. They go over and above for there patients.  I never feel rushed when calling there office or asking questions. I would highly recommend Dr Dalm!!	2
"I have been going to this office for several years.  I can honestly say that I have never had a bad experience with any of the staff.  Dr. Dalm is amazing.  Easy to talk to and explains everything needed to be done.  Always giving all the options.  The front office staff are helpful and accommodating and a joy to work with.  

I now have my 16 year old daughter using this office and she also feels very comfortable.  They made her feel very welcome and have answered all her questions and concerns"	2
Dr. Dalm was very nice and got me the outcome I wanted - a healthy baby. But he IS rushed. In fact, I've never seen a busier doctor. Appointments were short and to the point. Not loving his ultrasound tech who is also overbooked and very rushed. Love this office staff, though. They're very personable and totally on the ball. I had one interaction with the after hours answering service. They were 100% unhelpful, so I'm not sure how great he would be in an urgent situation after hours. 	2
Dr Dalm has extensive knowledge about pelvic pain, PCOS and endometriosis and really helped me understand what was happening inside my body. A lot of physicians will push pelvic pain to the side but he really understands & tries to help. His office staff is always friendly and he is pretty quick to see me when I am having an issue. 	2
I felt completely at ease with Dr. Dalm, he is an expert at what he does for sure.   Always was confident in his decisions and when I developed PreEclampsia he immediately took action and helped me get my blood pressure under control.  When it spiked again he made sure that me and my baby were in no danger.  I trust him with my life and recommend him to everyone.  I only wish he could be my PCP.	2
Dr Dalm took care of me through my high risk pregnancy and I always felt that he was on top of my medical problems. I have complete trust in him with my medical care! His office staff are amazing as well. I feel very comfortable with everyone there. 	2
Dr. Dalm is one of the best OB/GYN  Dr.'s in Grand Rapids. He is so kind  always puts his patients first. I recommend him to all of my family and friends! He is the best! 	2
I have been a patient for 26 years and have had the utmost compassionate care from Dr. Dalm.  The greatest addition to the office has been his PA who has listened and treated my hormonal changes over the past 5 years. 	2
I had a very stressful experience with Dr. Dalm.  His communication with me about my situation was so confusing I didn't know if I was going with my midwife or him until the day before going into labor. During labor I asked if I could go into a certain position that I knew would help me and he said it wouldn't help so he wouldn't let me move. Every time he checked my dilation it hurt really bad compared to all the other people who would do the same thing. His staff on the other hand was awesome.	0
Dr. Dalm never rushes through an appointment.  He always listens patiently to my concerns and answers all my questions.  I am always confident that he understands my situation and is thorough is diagnosing the problem and providing adequate information about all the treatment options.  I would recommend Dr. Dalm to all my friends!  Everyone that works at the clinic is wonderful to the patients.	2
Dr. Mitchell was the on call OB when my doctor couldn’t make it in and i wouldn’t want it any other way. He saved my sons life via emergency c-section and kept me as calm as he could during all the chaos. I don’t know that things would have went the way the went if it weren’t for him. Thanks to him today I have a healthy 4 month old son.	2
Dr Mitchell is wonderful. Needed a new Gyn after my last one passed away four years ago.  He was able to take care of my surgery and all my concerns. He is truly a caring physician. He asks about my son’s since my ex husband passed away the day of my surgery. He is truly a compassionate man. His staff is wonderful too. So thankful I found him	2
Never got to even see Dr. Mitchell because his staff messed up and treated me like a 2nd class citizen. they messed up on getting my medical info over the phone after i booked 3 weeks out and i show up and they say oh the nurse had been trying to reach you 1 day before my appt and it was my fault not answering back. i told them i been looking for to my appt has i have some pregnancy issues concerns and they turned me away to rebook another 3 weeks out unbelievable cold hearted staff. 	0
Dr. Mitchell is one amazing doctor. Went for a regular check up. I had questions and he answered them with no hesitation even gave me referrals to other problems i'm having. Hes the best ob doctor that made me feel comfortable, others will treat me like a number and rush you out the office. His staff is amazing as well. Mackenzie (hope I spelled her name correctly) she has the most bubbly personality and I felt I known her for years. The two receptionists were awesome as well. Thanks everyone. 	2
Dr Mitchell is the best ob/gyn I had the pleasure to meet him back in 1999 in California.  He helped me deliver my son 18 yrs ago and im so happy to found him here.  Dr I wish you the best because you always give your best to all of your patients.	2
Literally the best Dr ever!! i started going to Dr Mitchell when I had just turned 19 years old. He always did his best to make me feel comfortable. I fell in love with the nurses who are amazing. I am now going on 31 and he I still the best Dr and I refuse to change!!	2
Dr.Mitchell did a total hysterectomy removing a large amount of tumors. What a great Doctor! He was so attentive to my comfort after surgery. He had to make a large incision in which there is no scar. Just an amazing doctor and person. His staff are polite and pleasant. I couldn't have had a better experience under the circumstances. Thank you Dr. Mitchell and staff	2
Love this doctor. Would recommend to anyone. So disappointed I had to move during my third trimester and couldn't finish out my prenatal care with him. 	2
He was so nice and kind, he took the time to ask about my family and any question I had about what was going and explained in great details. I didnt feel rushed he made me feel very comfortable. His medical asst. was the best nurse I've ever had a doctors office. She was so amazing. 	2
Dr Mitchell performed both of my csections and has been an amazing and honest doctor from day one. He and his staff have been one of the key reasons I was able to make it out of postpartum depression and sleep deprivation without the use of meds. They were offered but I really didn't want to be on meds and they took the time to talk about EVERYTHING with me. Dr Mitchell and his staff are incredible!	2
Bedside manner is above and beyond.  Makes you feel comfortable. 	2
Dr Hoche was very friendly and very knowledgeable. 	2
"Dr Hoche is one of the best gynecologists I have ever gone to, and I’m 72 so have been to my share. She talks to you as if you are a friend 
and the whole exam is over before you know it. Oh and the warm table and foot stirrups and speculum make the whole exam much more comfortable   Answered questions I had about medication another doctor wanted me to take helping my decision and put my mind at ease. "	2
Dr. Hoche is wonderful and the staff is friendly. Everyone seems to be on the same page, organized and on point with what they are doing. They follow up with you on any questions or concerns. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a friendly and professional experience. 	2
Always takes her time and listens to and answers all questions.  Very gentle.	2
"Dr. Hoche and all the staff I have had the pleasure of interacting with (Leigh and Ashley) were wonderful!
Dr. Hoche was really down to earth and took her time to answer all my questions...every the silly ones :)
She made my husband and I feel very comforted and reassured during our visit and we look forward to working with her in the future."	2
Wonderful doctor and fantastic staff! The office feels like a spa. Robes and fuzzy socks, oh my goodness!	2
Such a wonderful Doctor ! Very knowledgeable! Very caring ! 	2
Such a wonderful practice. Great doctors and great new team!  They just expanded, growing positively, and redecorated. Beautiful experience. I recommend this practice to all my friends!	2
"I just love Dr. Hoche and her medical staff! I am a new patient and as always I was very nervous about going to a new doctor. The staff made me feel so at ease, especially Cali! Cali was very aware of my nervousness and made little jokes to make me laugh! The doctor didn't make me wait long and was very patient as I ""caught her up"" with my history. I have a new new GYN doctor!"	2
Dr. Hoche is a compassionate doctor who takes her time with you. The office is beautiful and the staff is very friendly.	2
Dr Hoche was very easy to talk to. Explained and informed me of everything I needed. Staff was very friendly and professional. Hardly any waiting time compared to most offices.	2
Dr. Hoche is thorough, knowledgeable, and to the point. Absolutely so grateful to have her as my doctor!	2
Great Doctor. Takes her time with you. Not just her, but the other 2 doctors at her practice too. I’ve seen her with other patients and she treats everyone with the same respect. Im picky about choosing a doctor, being a nurse, but I’m glad I go to this practice!	2
Dr Hoche is truly the best Dr I have been to. Not only did she thoroughly explained herself she also talked me through the procedure step by step. I was very nervous and she put my mind at ease. I will never go to another ob/gyn and I refer all my friends	2
Dr. Hoche is an AMAZING Dr!  She is so caring , and takes her time with you to make sure you understand everything. I would highly recommend her!  SHE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! 	2
Dr. Nay Hoche is wonderful.  She is knowledgeable and thorough.  She really takes the time to listen to all my concerns.  Her warm, engaging bed side manner put me at ease immediately.  I would highly recommend her to my family and friend.s.	2
The entire staff was very friendly and helpful with my daughters appointment. Dr. Hoche was very compassionate and caring and explain everything in terms my 14 could understand. Will definitely recommend. 	2
She is truly amazing. Her generosity, her personality, her patience it all top notch. I was at the end of my rope when I found Dr. Hoche. She is just truly amazing, I highly recommend her to all my friends! 	2
Dr.Hoche and her staff are excellent.  Very easy to talk to, caring, and professional. Dr.Hoche always takes time with her patients and makes sure to answer all questions thoroughly. You dont feel like just another patient...the staff is so welcoming. Thank you!	2
"Everything about my experience at this office was great! From my very first phone call to leaving the office I was treated better than any other doctor's office I've been to.
Everyone was kind and caring.
Loved Dr Hoche!! "	2
Dr. Hoche was extremely compassionate and actually listened.  I will be making her my primary Gyn! 	2
Dr. Hoche just delivered my little girl. She is phenomenal. Very knowledgeable, confident, calm, and personable. Exactly what you want in the delivery room. I can't express enough how grateful I am for her superior care, attention, time, and explanation. I would highly recommend Dr. Hoche!	2
Dr. Hoche is a fantastic doctor, I always look forward to seeing her. She answers all the questions you might have and obvioulsy truly cares about her patients. I highly recommend her!	2
Wonderful doctor! She is very professional as well as her staff! Highly recommend!! 	2
My previous physician stopped taking my insurance and fortunately I found Dr. Hoche! She took the time to review all of my records BEFORE she came in to meet me.  She answered all of my questions and made me feel at ease.  The office staff and manager were all friendly and welcoming!  Wonderful office and wonderful physician!  Highly recommend!	2
Dr. Hoche has been my doctor since early September when I found out I was pregnant! She is so knowledgeable and is great at putting my mind at ease (which is huge for my high anxiety self!!). I can't say enough great things about her. Truly. I highly recommend her and tell everyone I know how lucky I feel to have found her!!	2
Dr. Hoche and all her staff are caring, compassionate, and professional. My husband and I have gone through so much with my health. I feel that Dr. Hoche is right there to help me get back to health. Great doctor!	2
While the a situation I was in was not ideal, Dr. Hoche was very thorough and wanted to eliminate every possible outcome. She was very calming yet direct. She educates you on each of her theories for your situation and the possible outcomes. You feel so comfortable under her care.	2
Dr. Hoche is one of the best doctors I have ever encountered. She delivered my second daughter and was very caring and patient throughout the whole thing. She relates to her patients and has a passion for what she does. I am so glad that I came to this practice regardless that it is an hour away from my home! 	2
Dr. Hoche is the most caring physician I have ever met. She takes so much time with her patients and explains everything always making me feel comfortable. She could relate to what I was going through which made me feel even more comfortable. I would recommend her to any pregnant female because she will make your experience very positive.	2
Dr. Colon-Rivera was my life saver! I suffer from a rare pregnancy related illness called Hyperemesis Gravidarum, unfortunately with how rare it is and lack of research it can be difficult finding the right care. I was very fortunate to have found Dr. Colon- Rivera when I did, I was in a very bad, serious condition. She took action immediately and went through all the the treatment options until she found what worked for me. She always listens, observes and shows the upmost compassion for her patients. I appreciate her genuine kindness and am so grateful to have her as my OB! I am amazed at everything you've done for me and my unborn child. Thank you so much!	2
When I had a female problem I was referred to Obstetrics & Gynecology of Trinity by my GP.  I was so thankful to have Dr. Colon-Rivera for my doctor when I had to have my surgery.  She was so pleasant and caring.  She listened when I spoke and looked at me as I spoke.  (Something I don't get from other doctors)  She explained everything clearly to me and answered any questions I had.  I felt very comfortable with her.  I trust her and will definitely keep her as my doctor.	2
Dr Colon’-Rivera is the best GYN, in fact one of the best drs overall, that I have ever seen.   She is not only very knowledgeable but  through her patience, caring, and fantastic listening/communication skills is able to get to the real problem in a way that most drs cannot.   That is all too rare, and I appreciate it so much.  With the issue I’m presently dealing with, I feel like she’s the only Dr so far that I can trust.  And I am soooo grateful to have found her.  	2
The doctor was very kind and actually listened to me and addressed all of my concerns	2
I have never been to a doctor’s office with such rude receptionists or inability to pick up the phone no matter how many times you call, but Dr. Colon-Rivera and the nurses are amazing and extremely nice.	2
Excellent physician; she talks to you like 1) she has time to spare and 2) you have a brain in your head. 	2
"She is so professional 
She is very sweet 
She is very understanding 
I really like to follow with her If I get pregnant again 
She is very caring "	2
Dr. Colon-Rivera is my favorite doc! She is smart, compassionate, partners with her patients, she listens, you never feel rushed with her - she is so easy to talk with and ask questions. The whole team is fantastic. Highly recommend her.	2
Dr. Colon and her Medical Assistant Justine are amazing and one of the most caring and compassionate pair of medical staff I have ever met! 	2
Dr. Malieri Colón-Rivera is the best OBG doctor that I had. She treats you like a friend, take her time to get to know you and explain everything to you. She remembers me when she sees me and cares about me. Her office is new, clean, modern and organized. I love that I can make online appointments and I can enter my portal to see the test that had been done to me and my record. She  speaks English and Spanish and she is very good doctor she knows what she is doing and I recommend her.	2
I had a very good experience with Dr. Colon-Rivera, she was very kind, thorough and informative. 	2
So going for a woman's exam is not on my top ten fun list, I have to say my experience @ Dr Colon-Riviera's office was very pleasant, informative & non- stressful!!	2
 I am so very impressed with Dr. Malieri Rivera.  She listens intently.  Her diagnosis is right on the mark, and schedules treatments accordingly.  She makes sure I understand what is wrong and how we can best attack the problem.  I am very much at ease which hasn't always been my experience with other offices, and it is because of her warm personality.  I am so glad to have found her and Dr. Torres is lucky to have her as an associate.  She's very knowledgeable, 10 STAR MATERIAL !!	2
My experience with Dr. Colon was incredible. They accept self-pay patients and still provided me with a reasonable price for my planned C-section, prenatal visits and tubal. Dr. Colon was genuinely caring, even helping me deal with some emotional issues with my 5yr old. She performed my surgery and it went extremely well, much easier then my 1st. I was shocked it was over as quickly as it was, she removed the scar from my 1st surgery and I healed so quickly! I highly recommend her and her staff 	2
Dr Colon is caring, easy to understand and takes time with her patients. She never makes you feel like she's rushing in to the next appointment. She is one of the best doctors I've had in a long time. 	2
"having to take your 15 year old daughter who only recently entered woman-hood, the task of taking her to a gynecologist was daunting.  Dr. Colon-Rivera and her staff put her right at ease (and worried mom too).  From the first call I made to the office, every accommodation was made for me and for her. 
After the appointment, my daughter said, ""I liked that she pulled a chair up and spoke to me to give me information about my body."" No higher praise than that! "	2
The first time we met Dr. Colon-Rivera,  we felt comfortable. She is very professional at the same time very personable. 	2
Exceptional!! I have a mentally challenged daughter and Dr.colon-Rivera made her experience as comfortable as possible. Thank you for your professionalism. 	2
Dr. Colon-Rivera took very good care of me only problem I had to leave because they were not accepting my insurance anymore was very sad to have to leave 	0
I am so happy  with Dr. Rivera! She is super sweet and knowledgeable. She explains everything and is extremely thorough. 	2
"I love Dr. Colon-Rivera herself. She's treated me with understanding and respect and listens to my concerns related to my endometriosis and it's treatment. She doesn't blow me off like most doctors do. 

Unfortunately the office staff is beyond ridiculous. Getting through to talk to someone on the phone about prescriptions is impossible and their website they claim is efficient is all but. Every time I need to speak to someone at this office I end up in tears of frustration. "	0
Inconsiderate of patient's time. Even if you schedule first appointment of the day, you are still made to wait over an hour in waiting and, again, in examining rooms.  	0
Dr Dabelea took my concerns extremely seriously. He was kind. He took as much time as I needed and never seemed to be rushed. I feel that he is a very skilled and compassionate physician.	2
I love Dr Dabelea.  He delivered both of my children and cares for my needs currently.  He is a great doctor, very friendly, very professional, and always has availability when I need an appointment.  The office is nice and clean and the office staff and nurses are so friendly and helpful.  	2
Dr Dabelea performed a robotic myomectomy on my wife to preserve her fertility and avoid damage to her bladder, and also delivered our daughter by c-section. He is always calm and attentive, knows what to pay attention to, and doesn’t sweat the small stuff. He is an expert in his field. Colleagues listen to him when he speaks, and he has a calm and collected bedside manner. He is what all doctors should be.  My wife and I trust him greatly. He is a fantastic doctor to be involved with because he takes care of his patients from the examination room to the OR. It is plainly clear that his patients, not his practice, not the hospital, come first. Dr Dabelea is a caring and good man who took care of the people most precious to me.	2
Dr. Dabelea was great.  He listened to my concerns.  He didn't make me feel rushed, but the appointment was quick and efficient. (No waiting forever in the waiting room.)	2
Dr. Dabelea is a wonderful doctor with a great bedside manner! He spends as much time as needed with his patients to answer questions and go over concerns they may have. Highly recommended! 	2
Dr. Dabelea is wonderful doctor who is compassionate & kind.  He provides high quality care and takes the time to explain things & answer questions. I can’t recommend him and this office enough. 	2
Really great experience with him and I like the practice. Very dedicated and caring guy. Only thing I’d have to say is that he could be a little bit better at communicating what’s going on and why. 	2
Dr. Dabelea and his staff are wonderful. I had a complicated surgery, and they went above and beyond to make sure everything went well. 	2
Dr. Dabelea is very kind and takes time to listen and respond to any concerns or questions that you may have.	2
Dr. Dabelea is kind, caring  and knowledgeable. He takes time with you and listens to you. I highly recommend him.	2
"Dr. Dabelea is a fantastic physician.   He has the most caring and professional bedside manners I've seen in a great while.   He has given me the high level medical management I should've had years ago. I've been back on track because of him.  
"	2
Doctor Dabelea is very knowledgeable and takes his time with his patients. He always makes sure all of my questions and concerns are addressed during appointments. I would highly recommend him to anyone. He is amazing!	2
Dr. Dabelea is very personable and takes time to hear your health concerns.  He has great recommendations and is always careful to make sure that your treatment and preventative services are in line with your family history and concerns.  He has offered me great referrals as well, and as a surgery patient of his I have great trust in his abilities.	2
My experience was beyond awesome. Every step of the way you can call Sue for answers.  And my surgery was fast and recovery was great. I highly recommend Dr.Dabelea and his staff..	2
Dr. Dabelea is the best physician I have ever met.  He is straightforward, thoughtful, and honest.  After a medically complicated post-partum with my first child, I interviewed over 8 practices looking for a competent, caring, dependable doctor who I could trust with a future pregnancy.  Dr. Dabelea took the time to carefully review my medical records and provide honest feedback (something no one else did).  He provided amazing care to me during my second pregnancy and delivery. 	2
First off, the office is a cozy and comfy atmosphere. They answer the phone and schedule you the best they can and as quickly as possible. Dr. Dabelea is one of the most kind and professional doctors I've ever met. I went to him after several years of getting no answers with my old Ob Dr and office. I came here and was seen by him. He had me taken care of and treated within a little over a month of my first visit and on the road to recovery. I would recommend him to anyone and have to several.  	2
Dr. Dabelea takes time to find out my concerns and addresses each one. He also, is willing to answer all questions and allows me to very involved in my care. 	2
I have nothing but great things to say regarding my medical and surgical experience with Dr. Dabelea. 	2
This was my first survey ever. I was so scared I didn't make it to the operating room the first time. Second time I did and I am so glad I had him for a dr and surgeon. I would recommend to anyone	2
Dr. Dabelea is very kind and compassionate and takes the time to listen.  He is excellent at explaining pros & cons to potential procedures and makes you feel confident he will do an excellent surgery if I decide to pursue.  He provides information to help me to make a decision and is very respectful of whichever decision I will end up making. 	2
Dr. Dabelea is trult remarkable! I have never received such personal care from a physician. His compassion and dedication was obvious from my first encounter and with my phone conversations. I trust Dr. Dabelea to provide the surgical care and follow-up treatment that I require.	2
"Dr. Dabelea is a wonderful doctor, he listens well and will work hard to make sure you get the best care available! He is the BEST OB doctor I have ever had!!! 
"	2
He was great while I was pregnant. After while I was in severe pain he did a laporoscopy to remove endometriosis. I was still in horrendous pain.  He passed me off onto any other dr I couldThere were many times I missed important events and moments with my family and small children due to this including Christmas. As I couldn't get out of bed and so many other momentsI can never get back of my children toddlers at Christmas. There were so many times I just cried. I felt like he didn't believe me	0
Nurse Annita was so helpful and friendly, made me feel completely at ease for my first visit and the next, as well as helping me decide my birth control plan by encouraging me to discuss it with my parents and give it a day to think about it, which was such a good idea. Dr Dabelea was friendly and helped me understand exactly what was happening so I wouldn't be nervous and could Brace myself! He was gentle and it was over before I knew it. I got a painful shot that he made less painful and easy.	2
Dr. Dabelea is a fantastic doctor!  I suffered from Uterine Fibroids which caused me so much pain it was dibilitating.  I would feel like I was in labor sometimes 24-48 hours.  The pain and bleeding caused me to have to miss work and be hospitalized.  After having the surgery to have these fibroids removed I can live again pain free!  No more pain and very light bleeding on my cycles now.  I have minimal scarring on my abdomen and I'm anxious to begin trying to conceive!  You're the best!	2

Dr. Shah's office is very professional and he is also very dedicated and kind with his patients.  The staff at the office is always really nice and helpful. In my personal experience Dr. Shah and Julie Denton helped me a lot with my pregnancy.  They made an excellent job since it was high risk and got my twin baby girls successfully and happily delivered.  Thank you very much Dr. Shah. 	2
He is a great doctor and a human being. 	2
Dr. Shah is a great doctor. I love that he answers all my questions and concerns. I've had a rough pregnancy with my baby this time but with Dr. Shah I feel a little more calm because I know he will do what's best for me and my baby. I highly recommend him to any one.	2
Great doctor!	2
Dr. Shaw is Amazing. This is my second child with Dr.Shaw and everything was smooth from beginning to the very end.	2
Very patient and attentive. I felt very comfortable in his care.	2

Dr. shah has delivered all 3 of my girls, I have been seeing him since late 2011 & I will be going back in a month as I am pregnant with my 4th! My husband and I were 18 at the time and had no clue what we were doing,  but dr. Shah was there for us every step of the way. Especially for my husband, he answered all of his crazy questions and put him at ease! Dr. shah will be the only person I ever go to ! Thank you dr.shah! 	2
I am very happy I went with Dr. Shah. I didn't know a lot as this is my first child but from start to finish, everything went better than I could hope for. Thank you Dr. Shah!	2

Dr shah was very patient with my questions and made me feel safe during this otherwise scary process	2
Dr shah it's a good doctor I defenaly recommend dr shah	2
Very likely, he's a great doctor. 	2
I have been a patient and returning patient since 2007. He delivered all 4 of my kids and has been an amazing addition to my family. I would highly recommend him to anyone near or far	2
I'm so happy to have him as a doctor.. He was right on time and helped me through this pregnancy more than I expected. At the beginning I was a little worried because with my other children those doctors were a bit more personal.. But I just put my faith in with him and he fully delivered... And I'm thankful for that. 	2
He's a good doctor and knows what he's doing 	2
"Dr Shah is the ABSOLUTE BEST! I would not trust anyone else with my healthcare or my child's.
"	2
Very good and caring doctor.  Used him for all three of my pregnancies.  Love him!	2
Very good experience. Very professional.	2
Dr.Shah has been amazing Doctor during all my pregnancies, he is every understanding and helpful.	2
I would definitely recommend Dr Shah because he does an amazing job always and he truly cares for his patients.	2
No other words then AN AMAZING DOCTOR!  HE LOVES WHAT HE DOES AN MAKED YOU FEEL SO COMFORTABLE!!! 	2
This is my second child that Dr. Shah delivered by C section.  Both times I have had a smooth and easy experience.  I would recommend him to anyone looking for a great doctor whose down to earth and he does his job very well.	2
During my moms ceasection everything was quick and safe . Dr.Shah took really good care of my mom throughout the 8 month pregnancy of my mom 	2
Dr. Shah is beyond amazing! I switched to him when i was 4 months pregnant an i was so glad! He made me feel super comfortable an he explained everything perfect which was exactly what i needed Since that was my first an only pregnancy. I went through premature labor at 29 weeks an after 2 wks of bed rest he was able to keep my daughter growing inside me till 38 wks! He delivered my daughter in 2009 an has helped me thru other issues since. I have recommended him to several friends that love him	2
Loved that it was easy for me to trust in him and his professionalism.	2
Amazing	2
Dr. Shehadeh is very personable and is so very kind. She is more then a doctor I feel she is a friend and takes time to listen. I have been a patient for a few years and every visit l’m asked about family. Her care is gentle and concern genuine. I’m happy my sister recommended Dr. Shehsdeh for my G Y N health.	2
Love Dr. Shehadeh. Best doctor I have ever had.	2
Dr. Shehadeh is so nice and genuine, she truly cares for her patience. The staff is extremely friendly... HIGHLY recommend her and her office. 	2
"I truly love and respect Dr. Shehadeh ,  I have been going to her for probably as long as she opened her practice.
She follows through and also explains the procedures or tests if they are to be done. 
I feel I am in the best hands for my Gynecological care, I have recommended her to others and give her the highest mark of excellence.
Her office staff is beyond personable, also caring and follows through with phone calls, as in responses.
"	2
Super friendly, down to earth, and incredibly professional!  Never felt more comfortable at a Doctor's office. Did not talk down to me and actively tired to get to know me as an individual. Wonderful experience and cannot wait to continue to go to this office for many years to come. 	2
I've been to 4 different gynecologists after seeing her I'll never go to another, she is so good and thoughtful of you as a person not a patient she's very friendly and so easy to talk to i highly recommend her!!	2
I love her she is an awesome Dr,she tells you like it is and dont sugar coat anything ,everyones body is not the same,as is there pain tolerance,she gives you both sides just to be on prepared I would recommend her to anyone and always do	2
I went to see Dr. Laila yesterday for a 1st appt.  Dr. Laila read over my health history before she came into the room. She was very personable, caring & warm Dr. If all Dr’s were like Dr Laila our health system would be awesome. There are times where the staff is great and the Dr is not, or the Dr is great and the staff isn’t. In this office both were terrific. I feel really blessed to have been recommended to this office. I highly recommend Dr Laila and her staff. 	2
"Dr. Shehade h is a warm, friendly doctor who provided test results in a timely 
fashion. I only wish I had the opportunity to meet her sooner!"	2
Dr. Shehadeh is such an awesome amazing and professional doctor that takes her time and truly cares about you as the patient.  You do not feel rushed and her main focus is nothing but great care.  Her staff is wonderful too.  So glad someone referred her to me as I have referred her to others myself.  	2
"Dr. Shehadeh is AMAZING!!! As a new patient, she made me feel comfortable as if she had been my doctor for years. 

Thank You Again for such a comforting experience. "	2
Dr Shehadeh is amazing. She has a huge heart and truly cares about her patients.	2
Dr. Shehadeh is amazing. She along with her staff are very kind, courteous, and just have great attitudes. It can always be scary to go to the doctors and they just make you feel so comfortable. She is extremely knowledgeable and I am so happy I found her. 	2
I've been seeing Dr Shehadeh for a few years now. She is great! She's friendly, she remembers family details and asks about them, she listens to any concerns you have and always addresses them with detail and possible options for solutions. The office is clean, friendly, quick to please, and always willing to help in any way. I've recommended Dr Shehadeh to a few friends, some of which have actually switched doctors and have also fallen in love with her! 	2
I have never been to a more caring, professional OB. Dr. Shehadeh truly cares about your health and concerns. I feel like I am having a conversation with a close friend when I'm talking to Dr. Shehadeh. I would highly recommend her!	2
"She has always made me feel comfortable talking with her about my concerns.  She is very good at explaining things.  Her nurse is also very nice and professional.  I really couldn't ask for a better doctor.  I would recommend her to everyone I know!  The only reason I marked ""good."" On the question ""Ease of scheduling urgent appointments"" is because it takes a couple weeks to get in to see her.  But in all fairness, there may be more urgent needs than mine was."	2
She is very personable, and she will listen to what you have to say. Dr. Shehadeh has a fantastic bed side manner, very hard to find in doctors today.	2
Dr.Leman has been my provider for years I fully trust her and love the attention to detail they provide when I am seen. Very friendly timely and clean! I highly recommend her and have had meany friends and family seen by her and we all agree she’s simply the best! 	2
I found Dr. Leman when searching for a provider at the beginning of my previous pregnancy. I wanted someone who was personable. I’m now pregnant again and happy to be here again. Highly recommend dr. Leman and the office! 	2
Dr. Leman recently delivered my son and the experience was impeccable. The care I received in office prior to delivery was wonderful and the labor and delivery itself was a dream. She is great at answering questions, spending the right amount of time with you, and making you feel comfortable and properly cared for. I’m thankful to have found such a great healthcare provider. 	2
I originally gave them good stars due to good service. Until a month later when I get a bill for $140 dollars for going in for my preventative wellness check for refills on my birth control! First time I’ve ever gone here and DEFINITELY will never be back, I’ll be sure to let all friends and family to avoid this place. I even called their claims department and they said it was coded incorrectly but they would fix it and two week later I get the same bill for $140 dollars. What a SCAM! 	0
I have been with Dr. Leman for 10 years and will stay with her as long as she has a practice. She takes the time to talk to you, makes sure you understand options, is patient and professional. Her staff is excellent and my appointments are always on time. I could not give a stronger recommendation for any health care provider.	2
I recently relocated and needed to find a gyne asap due to a health condition that was discovered in the process of my move. The staff was so kind and helpful when I called to schedule and when I came in for my appt. Dr. Leman exceeded my expectations. I came with a ton of anxiety about my condition and she listened carefully, answered every question and laid out all my treatment options and possible outcomes. She put my mind at ease and I feel confident I made a great choice for my female care.	2
Dr. Leman and her team were great! I have finally found a doctor's office that really cares for my owerall health as a woman. Thank you Dr. Leman and the team!  	2
I was very happy with Dr. Leman. I was very surprised at how much time she spent with me answering questions and listening to what I had to say. It was a good overall appt.	2
"I love Dr. Leman, and Nikki, and the whole staff. They are personable, and really try to get to know me. Nikki has even gone above and beyond helping me. 

Last year I knew I was going to have a baby, so i shopped for insurance knowing that all i wanted was an insurance Dr. Leman accepted."	2
We found out we were pregnant in Jan 2017, I am 5 months along now. I couldn't seem to find an OB that I loved, felt comfortable with, could ask questions, and respected their answer. Then I found Dr. Leman. From the minute you walk in to Colorado Woman's care you feel welcome. Everyone was unbelievably sweet, caring, and made you feel so important. I have only been there once, but my 20 week is this week and I am looking forward to being back. She came highly recommend to me. 	2
Dr Leman was very kind y made room for me to get in quickly when it appeared urgent.	2
Easily one of the best doctors I've ever had to see. She's extremely personable so you'll feel like more than just a patient when you go here. They've always fit me into their schedule quickly when I need it, and they're extremely thorough and walk you through anything you're unsure about. 	2
Dr. Leman is amazing and I highly recommend her. From the moment I checked in, to the moment I checked out, I have literally never felt as cared for as I have with her and Women's Care of Colorado's entire staff. She effortlessly makes you feel like you are special and you can tell she truly cares for you, and women in general. I have been to several OB doctors. None of them ever offered, or even mentioned, the procedure she told me about, and that I ended up choosing. CHOOSE DR. LEMAN!!!!!!	2
I would always recommend Dr Leman to any friend or family member. When Dr Leman changed locations I saw a different doctor. But only a couple months later I found out I was pregnant and knew I had to see Dr Leman. I wouldn't put prenatal care in anyone else's hands. 	2
Her office is not very organized. For every visit they had to make mistakes.	0
Unclear billing, won't answer any question without an appointment although I have been seen more than 6 times. 	0
Makes patients feel very comfortable and I can genuinely say I enjoy going for my yearly visits. Always has great advice and explains things very clearly.	2
Dr. Leman is great at taking the time to talk about patients concerns and explaining her answers.  She cares about the future care of her patients and discusses long term options for their health care.  She made me feel very comfortable during my entire pregnancy and birth.  She listened to my concerns and validated them. I really trust Dr. Leman as my OBGYN! 	2
great at explaining	2
Dr. Ayim and all her staff are very welcoming and made my first visit a great one. I would highly recommend.	2

Everything is great.	2
she listened to everything.	1
She was very nice and made a lot of conversation.	2
I have been a patient with Dr. Daisy for about 5 years now and she is great! I love her and her nurse practitioner Virgina. The staff is friendly and helpful as well.	2
Dr. Ayim is really sweet! I noticed a lot of stuff for cosmetic surgery around her office which made me question if I was at the right place at first, but my well woman exam went well and I feel I can trust her.	2
"Nice job on the Office lift.

Staff was very nice.
Doctor was even better with a lovely attitude :)"	2
the office is nice and always a smooth, easy, in and out process. I've come to Dr Ayim for my woman services for a few years always sweet and kind spirited.	2
Dr Ayim was very kind and took her time.  I felt like there was no one scheduled today but me. She is very knowledgeable and patient.	2
She took her time and explained what I needed to know. Very professional!	2
Great to see Dr. Ayim! She was very informative and helped me understand a few things I was questioning. Look forward to the next visit with her!	2
I always reveive the most personal care and feel valued as a patient	2
Amazing doctor!!! Great listener to all your concerns.	2
I was a little hesitant with coming in because my friend  was visiting and i knew with my complaints i was going to have to be checked. Dr Ayim made me feel very comfortable and eased my nerves. as a new  patient she made me feel like a priority and that everything was going to be ok. She addressed my current needs and also took care my future needs. I read reviews on Dr. Ayim before coming and her bedside manners are awesome. I'm glad i took a chance.	2
New Patient here, Dr. Ayim made made me feel like I belonged. I am glad I chose her.	2
friendly , and informative. very fun appointment	2
Dr. Ayim was very nice and attentive, she listen to my concerns and was gentle in the exams. Would recommend.	2
She is not in my network and not close to my side of town. She is worth the drive and the pay out of network.	0
my experience with dr. ayim was absolutely wonderful. she is warm, and very caring. i would recommend her services to others, and she is very knowledgeable.	2
i love her welcome back doctor i missed you	2
She listens to all my concerns and has unbelievable bedside manners. Thank you for all you do!	2
I am a new patient and I was completely satisfied with my visit felt comfortable , secure, and care for . Extremely pleased	2
It was great and i feel confident that she will help me.	2
definitely recommend Dr. Iwaloye. He delivered both of my sons and couldn’t ask for a better doctor.	2
"Just an incredible Dr. I highly recommend Dr. Iwaloye. He treated my daughter will great care and highest regard.  I'm very thankful to him.
God bless him always."	2
He is an amazing doctor!! He cares about all his patients and listens to concerns. He also delivered my daughter and made sure everything went smoothly after. I wouldn’t trade him for any other doc!!!	2
Amazing doctor ! He delivered my first baby and handled all my pregnancy ! 	2
Great doctor,  Good listener & very caring!  Would recommend 	2
"He's. Great doctor. He really cares about his patients and well being. I would recommend to anybody.
"	2
Friendly, knows what he was doing,very professional, makes you feel very comfortable, kind, compassionate,funny,makes you feel safe, always on time to deliver my 2 babies. Good listener, a good doctor all in all. We're actually sad that after today's visit we may never see him again after our second child. We have grown fond of him. We highly do recommend Dr. Iwaloye 100% hands down.	2
great doctor 	2
As a new patient, Dr. Iwaloye took the time to see me in a private room and asked for my previous health history. Amazing bedside manners. Genuinely concerned about his patients. He is a GEM!  I highly recommend him. Front staff need to be more courteous. Will settle because I will not go to anyone else.	2
After having a terrible experience with the Doctor that delivered my first child I decided to try Dr Iwaloye. He was great since day one takes you into his office ask you about your family medical history makes you feel very comfortable. 	2
"I had a good first experience with Dr. Iwaloye. The front desk staff was not very welcoming but the Dr. makes up for it. He takes you into his office before the exam room and talks to you about your medical history while you are still dressed. After the interview, you are moved to the exam room and proceeds with the exam. 

He is very knowledgeable and professional. I will be returning for the second appointment. "	2
An excellent doctor who took care of my wife and answered all of her questions. Seemed genuinely concerned about all of her issues and seems to genuinely enjoy his job. Best doctor we have visited and decided to go with.  He's an excellent doctor and couldn't ask for better. 	2
He refused to even see me because I have an allergy to yeast and as a side effect I have yeast infections... ? 	0
Excellent and professional.  I would recommend him to everyone I know.  In one visit, he found out what was wrong and put me on the correct treatment plan--something the last 4 dr's couldn't seem to do.  	2
Attempted to get an appt for my son who has allergies, asthma and eczema.  The receptionist who answered the phone seemed bothered and sick. I could barely understand what she said when she answered the phone. I explained to her that we were having issues with my sons asthma. She quickly asked is he a new patient and said they aren't seeing anyone new until January. That is completely understandable but I also asked for a few other doctors who would offer similar services. Told me to call	0
Quality of care is excellent!  Dr. Haden is quite knowledgeable about current allergy diagnoses and treatments.  The PA who works with him is also knowledgeable. Nursing staff--all excellent, caring, prompt, and knowledgeable.  Allergy shots have < 5 min wait.  The only downside is the MD/PA appointment wait time. Even 0800 (first appointment of day) will be a 40-50 min or more wait to see either the MD or PA. An Yogi   	2
He is very up to date on current research and very smart.  He was thorough and had a great plan to help my daughter.	2
The person that processed my fmla paperwork was not very friendly and did not make me feel comfortable asking her questions. I have never used fmla before so I was confused how it worked. She just looked at me like I was stupid. When I asked her about getting a doctors excuse for missing work she replied oh I can't authorize that I would have to talk to the doctor. I could tell she did not want to help me at all. Trying to talk to her was like trying to pull a nail out of a 2?4 without a hammer.	0
First dr to identify the source of the idiopathic urticaria I've suffered for over 30 years.  Superb.	2
Dr. Paluvoi is so good to our 4 year old. We came for her peanut allergy test. “Dr. P is so kind”-Kaela. For us parents, he was thorough with educating us about our kid’s allergy causes, symptoms and treatment. He gave us handouts as well. Great experience. 	2
He’s a very friendly doctor and really seems to know his stuff!	2
My first time seeing Dr. Paluvoi was a great experience! His office is very clean, and staff were all very welcoming and informative. I will be continuing care with him doing allergy shots. 	2
Takes his time. Very thorough. Digs deeper into the causes. Doesn’t just push meds or shots. 	1
Great experience doctor was friendly and informative as well as the staff!	2
Very good doctor 	2

Excellent!  Took lots of time explaining everything to me and made me feel as though he really cared about making me feel better!	2
I am very happy with Dr. Paluvoi and his staff and I recommend this team.	2
Very likely. Felt it was a thorough understanding of my situation and at end, I feel confident in the process and recommendations. 	2

We love Dr. Paluvoi!  My son has been seeing Dr. Paluvoi for 11 years, since he began having allergic reactions to foods and environmental triggers at age 1.  Dr. Paluvoi is very gentle and friendly.  He is patient and thoughtful; he always gives us plenty of time and never seems rushed.  He is good with children and makes them feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend Dr. Paluvoi! 	2
"Dr Paluvoi  always answers my questions to the fullest.
The nurse practitioner was also very helpfuf and thorough."	2

Good and quick service!  Takes care of my allergies. Have been patient for several years. 	2
Good visit. Very professional. Answered all of my questions. 	2
He is the number one doctor in Lansdowne. I brought my daughter when she was an infant. Her allergy was very bad.but with the medication that he described. My daughter is now doing absolutely good.	2

Very professional and takes time to explain treatment very well	2
We love Dr. Paluvoi! We never have issues getting an appointment that fits our busy lives. The wait time is NEVER long and there is hardly ever a wait. I always plan at least an hour but we are generally in and out within 30 minutes. The staff treats my children wonderfully,even the children that aren't patients. He knows our family history and always engages making sure the rest of the family is well. He is so easy to work with and will spend all the time we need to answer any question we have.	2

"	2
He is really nice and patience; listens carefully at what you say and recalls everything that you said. I feel like he really cares. Thank you doctor ??	2
My son has severe environmental allergies and has been coming to Dr. Paluvoi for several years. He makes sure to accommodate the needs of his patients and listens to concerns. The staff is friendly and helpful. My son is able to play outside and enjoy outside activities thanks to his working with Dr. Paluvoi.	2
I would definitely recommend Dr. Paluvoi to family and friends. He is highly professional and systematic, accurate diagnosis skills. He understands the problem and addresses the problems/issues patiently without rushing. 	2
I highly recommend Dr paluvoi if you are suffering from seasonal, food allergies, asthma and immunology. my son was suffering from asthma and seasonal allergies he was not able to sleep  at night and he was not able to go outside to play  he was in ER every week, but since I started seeing Dr paluvoi my son is feeling great his asthma  and allergies are very well control. Excellent staff after checking in we never have to wait for more then 5 min. he is a great Doctor. 	2
The most dynamic, intuitive person I've ever met in the medical field. This is a special guy	2
"Dr. Don saved my life years ago when he diagnosed me with hypogammaglobulinemia. I never hesitate to tell people about him. He has more knowledge and better bedside manner than most. My husband and daughter would also highly recommend him.
                                                 Judy Harrill"	2
Dr Knauer is my savior! He doesn't give up, I've been seeing him for 20 years now and he didnt tell me my pain and fatigue were in my head! It took time but he didn't stop and I am finally living!! And can hold a job! I love his dedication to his patients!	2
I have referred many patients to Dr. Knauer. He is very knowledgeable and always gets to the bottom of what’s going on.	1
He takes his time and thoroughly explores your symptoms and provides recommendations for improvement..  This could include when you take medications, foods you should avoid, alternative medications, etc.  	1
I was very impressed with Dr. Ford.	2
Dr. Ford is a very nice man. He listens to you and cares about what your situation.	2
The Very Best ENT specialist is Dr. Ford.  Skilled, thorough, caring; he listens, asks right questions, explains understandably what procedure/medication is needed.  He has genuine concern, takes adequate time/not hurried.  I have gone to Dr. Ford over the years for ENT issues.  Always received best care.  Kudos to Dr. Ford!	2
 Always attentive and spends time with me to listen, evaluate and address any concerns and problems I may have. 	2
I have been seeing Dr. Ford for 3 years now and he and his staff at the allergy clinic have been miracle workers for me. It's difficult to even tell you how much better my allergies and overall health is since I began seeing Dr. Ford. His staff at the allergy clinic are knowledgeable, kind, caring and friendly.  I believe Dr. Ford's mission in life, not just his occupation, is to care for and comfort the sick.	2
Years later, I had surgery again. During that surgery massive amounts of scar tissue and incorrectly constructed structure were deemed to be the reason I suffered for the past 15 years with sinus problems. I would not recommend him as a surgeon. It took a whole year for the allergy Dept. to realize I couldn't do their allergy shots. I was just given more steroids when I complained.	0
Dr Ford has taken excellent care of my wife. She is struggling with a sinus condition and he has gone the extra mile consistently to diagnose and treat her. He has always shown compassion, loving care, and a commitment to her comfort through her surgery’s.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Ford for many years. Through all of my complaints, outpatient surgeries and hospitalizations he has been as consistently caring, compassionate and professional more than any doctor I know. He has been instrumental in diagnosing a rare autoimmune disease and has guided me in the proper direction for care outside of his expertise. More importantly, he continues to follow my progress interacting with my other providers. There aren’t many doctors like Dr. Ford. 	2
I am 55 and have had year round allergies since I was a child. I've taken allergy shots as a child, and as a young adult. This never helped. I used allergy pills and sprays for years and still had constant nasal congestion. I was told I needed treatment for allergies. Having 'been there/done that' with shots, I was totally skeptical in trying Dr. Ford's plan for me, a 3-fold approach including the shots. I only tried it because my insurance paid for it. After 3 months I say WOW, no kidding!	1
Dr Ford is the best and also very nice !.	2
Dr. Ford is a model doctor and person. He has been my doctor over 15 years. Everything about his office is professional. He has helped me with allergies, surgeries, and other ENT needs. He is a class act. He listens extremely well, examines, and then formulates a plan. He explains carefully and answers all questions. He is always seeking to improve his practice. The supporting staff is also amazing. 	2
Dr. Ford was very Thorough and Knowledgeable about his profession and very easy to understand.	2
I had been having frequent sinus infections for over 10 years. The one prior to the surgery activated mono. I needed relief! The congestion wasn't draining. I received allergy testing and Dr. Ford conducted a CT scan. Dr. Ford recommended sublingual immunotherapy & Balloon Sinuplasty. The surgery (Dec. '15) was successful. Congestion drains easily now with the use of a neti pot. My energy keeps improving. Throughout Dr. Ford & the entire staff have been top-notch to me. I am so grateful!	2
I was on vacation in Florida when I started to get some very heavy nose bleeds. I finally went to the emergency room in South Florida, and they cauterized my nose. But, the next night , my nose bleeds started all over again. I went to a second EM, and was told they do not have an ENT doctor there or on call. So, I called my ENT Dr. Ford, and he said if I could make it to Boone the next day, he would fit me in. I drove 675 miles in 11 1/2 hours to get there. He fixed it, and no bleeds since.	1
Dr. Ford accurately diagnosed acid reflux as the cause of my chronic cough. After a year of treatment including a change of diet, three prescriptions and several visits, the cough is gone, my sleep apnia has abated and I am sleeping much more soundly. He is jovial, positive and takes a team approach with his patients. I love his manner, his explanation of what is happening and his professionalism.	2
Dr. Ford and his staff always make your visit as relaxing and stress free as possible.  He is a very caring, compassionate doctor.	2
Dr. Ford is a extremely thorough physician who always HEARS my concerns. He has been my ENT for at around 14 years and through this time my health needs have changed drastically. His continual care for me shows with each office visit as he never rushes these appointments and does a thorough examine. My autoimmune disease is challenging and Dr. Ford, is compassionate and continually looks for new ways to  help, heal and provide comfort. My only concern I have with Dr. Ford is his retiring!!! 	2
Dr. Ford is an excellent physician who knows and practices his specialty in an exceptional fashion.  He possesses and displays warm interpersonal skills taking the time to explain to his patient the nature of the problem and its solution(s).  I recommend him highly.	2
I find Dr. Ford to be highly skilled, showing great concern for his patients and very caring in his manner. 	2
I first visited Dr. Ford 6 months ago because several conditions including  acid reflux disease, Meniere's disease, deviated septum, and hypertrophied turbinate membranes, which I had failed to address over a number of years, suddenly converged and intensified and I became very ill. Over the intervening period Dr. Ford has treated all these conditions (the treatments included surgery) with great competence, tremendous empathy, and exemplary bedside manner. I am now well on the way to recovery.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Ford for around 15 years and my son since birth. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone needing ENT services. He is very knowledgeable, gentle, and extremely caring of his patients. I've had extensive issues and he has helped each and every time. 	2
I have had trouble with sinus headaches for years. Dr. Ford cleared them up for me and further improved my health by testing me for allergies. He then started me on an allergy shot regime which has made me feel better than I have in years. He has further helped me with hair loss and acid reflux. He and his office staff are the best and not only do I thank them so much for all they have done for me but I hardily recommend him.	2
Dr. Ford is the most caring doctor I have ever had!  He always took time to listen to me and answered all my questions. He was never willing to give up on me even when I was ready too.  I am very blessed to call him my doctor and friend. THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO!	2
I have been treated by Dr. Ford since 2004. He has treated me for asthma, allergies, chronic sinusitis, Graves' disease, and thyroid cancer. I am happy to say that his knowledge and skills have resulted in my being in good health today. I did have sinus surgery after trying all conservative measures to no avail. The surgery brought an end to the chronic sinusitis. Dr. Ford also removed my thyroid gland which resolved both the thyroid cancer and Graves' disease.  I highly recommend Dr. Ford. 	2
Great doctor, explain the fact, and is concerned about your health care. 	2
wonderful specialist with awesome personality.  Got me diagnosed with Vestibular Migraines and got them under control with sub-lingual drops, tweaking my meds and sending me to a physical therapist specializing in vestibular disorders.  Can't say enough good things about this physician and the level of care I have received.	2
Dr. Ford is a very caring person. When he came and talked to me right before I went into surgery, he said he liked to pray with his patients before he started the operation. I have never had that to happen to me before, a Dr. praying with me. But I knew at that time, he was of strong faith with our God, and that put me at peace. I knew that I was going to be just fine. When he took my hand in his, closed his eyes and started praying to our God in Heaven that he knew what he was doing.	2
After having a chronic cough for over five years which continued even after being treated by many other doctors, Dr. Ford stopped my coughing with the first office visit. He had a plan for me and it worked. Both my husband and I are so thankful.  	2
I was with Dr. Ford approximately 5 minutes and already had more information and confidence in him than any specialist I have seen in the past 11 months. He treated me as a patient with a real and serious medical issue rather than a number or dollar amount. 	2
"Dr Jag is a really great Dr!!! He takes TIME to REALLY LISTEN, fully explore different health concerns , etc. He was extremely thorough in discussing all possibilities. 
I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND him to anyone with allergies, especially with more difficult diagnoses. 
His office staff is very friendly, as well!
I can guarantee that you will feel like you’ve found a Dr who will go to extra lengths to really listen and care about you as an individual!!!"	2
Dr. JAG and his staff are amazing!  After moving to Colorado from Texas and experiencing severe allergies and sinus issues- I am feeling better for the first time in over a year.  Dr. Jag is extremely thorough, patient and a great listener.  The staff is also on target with scheduling appointments, following up on action items and overall friendliness.  A+++	2
Thanks to Dr Jag I have my asthma, my allergies, and my sinuses under control. Dr Jag listens to his patients. He found a bone spur that National Jewish Hospital missed. Finding the spur has meant 90% less sinus infections. Hurray ! His staff knows the patients and are of great help. Thank all of you at the office more than I can say. Lynda W.	2
Great doctor	2
Dr Miller is an excellent physician! He is very knowledgeable, super caring and compassionate. He treats my kids like his own and everyone on his staff has been wonderful! I highly recommend Dr Miller and the Allergy Station!	2
"I've been a patient of Dr.Millers for close to 10 years.  I came to him for his knowledge and background in my somewhat rare immuno deficiency, CVID. He has always been a trusted medical advisor, very approachable and easy to talk to, providing advice with thorough explanation I can understand. He's genuine and provides for short term solutions, while having a goal for long-term health. Dr. Miller is caring, smart and humorous, a desirable combination in a doctor.
I highly recommend Dr. Miller for both adults and children looking for quality health care."	2
Dr Miller is awesome and very knowledgeable.  He has helped us determine the cause of our daughters many illnesses over the last winter.  Thank you to the great team at The Allergy Station!  Amber 	2
We started seeing Dr Miller last year when my son was covered in hives and having trouble breathing.  Everywhere else we took him to be seen the process took so much time and I was unwilling to see my child suffer in the system.  Immediately Dr. Miller started him on brand new vitamins and medicine to help him.  He has recovered in record time and we have a brand new approach to keeping this from happening again.  Its invaluable to have Dr. Miller and his team on your side, all the time. Its a peace of mind you can not get anywhere else.  His kindness and attentive approach is not found elsewhere.	2
I greatly appriciate the personal care I receive from all the staff here! They are always checking in on me to see how I am doing. I am so glad I found them!	2
I have been with Dr. Miller for several years! He is always kind and has the best bedside manners. Before working with Dr. miller my health was terrible we were not able to get me under control or keep me out of the hospital. Dr. Miller worked with me and my active life style to find what worked. So nice to have a doctor that actually cares and is willing to fight for your health!	2
I highly recommend Dr. Travis Miller.  We have followed him from Capital Allergy, to SacENT, to his own practice because he is a brilliant doctor.  Dr. Miller treats his patients holistically, he does not just look at symptoms. With extensive medical knowledge beyond his specialty, he looks at the big picture and does not shy away from a challenging situation.   He has been the only doctor that could put together the complex autoimmune symptoms together and devise a plan for my children.	2
Very happy with service.	2
Great visit. Easy to schedule an appointment when it was convenient for us. 	2
"Dr Travis Miller and his staff at The Allergy Station in Roseville California are all wonderful.
They care, listen and understand the patient's situation and they are all so very helpful and friendly too.
If we ever have a problem with our son's asthma or allergies, we can text Dr Miller and he will always respond and give us reassurance of the situation. 
As parents, that is really fantastic. 
If I could give the rating more than 5 stars I would. Thank you for everything you do Dr Miller.  "	2
Dr. Miller is extremely knowledgable and caring.  He listens and works cooperatively with his patients to develop realistic plans of care.  Staff is great, too.	2
"Dr. Miller and his staff are the best in the business. They take the time to listen to their patients and genuinely care about their health. I saw Dr. Miller during my pregnancy and he communicated between my OB and myself constantly as we figured out my allergy. My OB also mentioned how impressed she was with his follow up and communication.

I've since brought in my 7-year-old daughter who is VERY nervous about doctor visits, etc. She was so nervous the day of the appointment but within 5 minu"	2
I have known Dr. Miller for many years now as he has been my allergist.  He took time to figure out what was wrong with my body and helped fix it.  He truly cares for my needs and is always available to talk to his patients.  I highly recommend Dr. Miller because he is a patient doctor who wants to understand his patients as more than just patients, but rather as people.	2
So very grateful to Dr. Miller! My son needed to be seen by a doctor but the soonest our primary care doctor could get us in was the following week.  I didn’t feel comfortable waiting that long so I called Dr. Miller and he immediately told me to come by the house so he could check him out. I can’t tell you what a relief it was to have my son seen within the day. This is the type of doctor Dr. Miller is and why I know that his new practice is going to be such a benefit to his patients. 	2
Dr. Miller is absolutely the best!  Not only does he listen and communicate well, but he is also extremely knowledgeable and truly cares for his patients.  Our boys have been seeing Dr. Miller for the past eight years.  His expertise and tenacious problem-solving skills have been superb in diagnosing and treating each of their unique situations.  We are so grateful for Dr. Miller and his compassionate care through the years!	2
Dr. Miller takes as much time as needed with my family and works to find the best solutions to their allergy problems. Love that he is always available anytime we need him!	2
I can’t say enough wonderful things about Dr. Miller as well as Abby. They go above and beyond when it comes to their patients. When our younger son was diagnosed with severe food allergies and asthma at the young age of 2 we were terrified. We both  have asthma, but the food allergy was something we were not prepared for. He walked us through the whole thing with all the support and kindness you could ask for.  He takes care of my family and I trust in him. He is the BEST doctor ever. 	2
Dr Miller is always kind has the newest information and spends time to individualize my sons treatment plan! 	2
Dr. Miller was fantastic!  I have visited multiple doctors and could not figure out why I kept being afflicted by a mystery rash.  He took two visits, he ruled out one thing at a time and was so thorough to make sure  that it was not allergy or auto immune.  He figured it out, and I am so relieved!  His staff is so nice Rodrigo (Gogo) was super intelligent.  Dr. Miller is a rockstar!	2
Dr. Kim and the team at Allergy Partners have been great! They're professional, kind and caring! My son is doing the oral immunotherapy for peanuts and they've been amazing - providing timely advice along the way when we've had any issues whatsoever. I'd highly recommend Dr. Kim!	2
Dr. Kim and his staff are amazing. They are courteous and incredible knowledgeable. I highly recommend this practice for food allergy, seasonal and pet allergy, asthma and OIT.	2
All the reviews are true! Excellent experience with my 2.5 year old who went for allergy testing. There are toys in the waiting room and movies to watch during the testing. He was extremely thorough, explained everything very clearly, and gave us a comprehensive treatment plant. Happy mom here!	2
Dr. Kim and his staff provide exceptional service and care. Dr. Kim is professional and competent in his treatment and evaluation. Dr. Kim's staff are wonderful. I have been getting allergy shots at this office for more than a year.  The staff is friendly, competent, and helpful with insurance processing, scheduling and answering questions.  The nurses are kind, competent & efficient. They carefully  manage patient serums and closely monitor patients for adverse reactions.	2
Immunization program got me to a maintenance level in very short order.  Treatments were effective at controlling my seasonal allergies.  Staff was friendly, efficient, and effective.  Would highly recommend to anyone (and I have!).	2
Dr. Kim is great and his office keeps very convenient times for allergy shots!	2
Dr. Kim and his staff are so attentive.  Willing to get to the bottom of the issues and find solutions.  Dr, Kim is very dedicated to his art and even calls patients back directly (rather than a nurse).  After 3 months of severe hives, I am finally hive free and working on lessening my meds for allergies.  I highly recommend Dr. Kim and all of his staff for great service and professionalism. 	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Kim to my family and friends.  He is caring and concerned about my care.  He explains everything in detail and provides the best options for care.  His staff is top notch as well.  	2
Dr. Kim is a caring doctor who spends a lot of time listening to patients - a rare thing! I always feel like my concerns are important to him. He works hard to help me with serious asthma and allergy issues, and I have complete faith in him. His staff is also very attentive and kind. The entire office runs like a well-oiled machine with heavy doses of caring and thoroughness, interspersed with a little humor to brighten your day. I highly recommend Dr. Kim and his staff.	2
Allergy Partners is the absolute best. When I first came to see Dr. Kim, I literally just started crying when he entered the room.  My allergies had gotten so bad, it was killing me.  It was completely interfering with my life. Two years later, I feel great. I now just get my allergy shots once a month and I almost never have any symptoms! The people at Allergy Partners are awesome.  They always try to make my shot visits easy and quick. I can't recommend AP highly enough!	2
We have been seeing Dr. Kim for many years and have referred many friends to him.  He has been wonderful in treating our son for seasonal allergies and our daughter, for food allergies.  In addition to him, we love the amazing staff who work with him.  We are always so thankful for his patient and comforting nurses who administer our son's allergy shots.  Getting shots is never fun, but they make it as easy as possible for him.  I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Kim.	2
My son's pediatrician referred us to Dr. Kim four years ago. Now my husband and I also see Dr. Kim.  He's a great doctor!  He takes the time to make sure his patients understand their allergies and treatment. He's a good listener, professional, very knowledgeable, and even has a sense of humor!  	2
I was referred by my primary care physician for help with snoring. Dr. Kim and his whole staff are great! My snoring is better and I discovered that my allergy to cats is not just in my head. I am now being treated and looking forward to sleeping better. I still hate cats though. 	2
"Dr. Kim is extremely personable and will go the extra ""mile"" for his patients. I had an allergic reaction one time in a movie theater and went to the closest urgent care. On my way, I called Dr. Kim's office and asked whether or not I should go. He asked me to have the doctor at urgent care to call him, which of course, was after his normal business day. Dr. Kim spoke with the urgent care doctor to make sure I was getting the proper treatment for the reaction. He also called me later at home."	2
Dr. Kim has diagnosed my son's multiple food allergies and environmental allergies.  He makes it easy to understand and works with us to try to find a way to manage his eczema as well.  He responds quickly to any questions or concerns we have had over the years.  His office staff is friendly and goes above and beyond to help kids through the process.	2
I was a long time seasonal allergy suferer and always dreaded the allergy season, until I saw Dr. Kim. This is the best treatment i had so far and allergy season is no longer an issue for me.	2
Dr Kim has helped me to successfully manage my allergies.  The staff is professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.	2
He takes the time to get to know each patient. Even though he is the only doctor and it is an obviously busy practice, it still feels personal. The office staff and nurses are wonderful! So sweet, attentive, and caring. Not just about why you are there but you as a person.	2
On time and takes time to listen to patients concerns and the whole picture of one's health.  He loves what he does as does his staff.  Helps people get the proper medications  Some allergic conditions can be difficult to treat, and he is diligent.  	2
This is a great practice with good staff.  Dr. Kim is great about giving a lot of information and answering all kinds of questions.	2
Dr. Kim helped me with issues I've been experiencing for years. He listens and really cares. The staff are fantastic and get to know the patients. If you are looking for an allergist look no further than Dr. Kim and his team! 	2
The staff is friendly and personable. Plus the allergy shots are working.	2
I would recommend Dr. Kim's office without reservation. I have always been taken care of quickly and their office is always staffed with friendly faces.	2
Dr. Kim has been very thorough in his explanation of my diagnosis and treatment. He has a great bedside manor and is able to quickly walk you through the treatment options. The staff is always pleasant and friendly. Scheduling appointments is never complicated and wait times are short for shots. 	2
I have been coming to Allergy Partner's of Northern VA for 3 years.  The care, and staff are wonderful.  Before coming, and starting allergy shots, I was getting acute bronchitis 3-4 times a year.  I have rarely gotten sick since.  Dr. Kim really knows his stuff!	2
Dr. Kim and his staff are great! Always greeting you as you walk in and very prompt and efficient with appointments and shots. I would recommend Dr. Kim to anyone struggling with their allergies. 	2
Dr. Kim was very kind and trustworthy. His explanations were clear and concise.	2
Dr. Kim is very patient with my son and always makes sure all my questions are answered before we leave.	2
When I moved into the area  he was highly recommended. I have been very pleased with Dr. Kim and his staff. 	2
Excellent. Does not rush your appointment. Also if you call with a question Dr. Kim is the one returning your call if front desk cannot answer.	2
Dr. Kim is easy to talk with and listens to your concerns flowing up with a plan that can be implemented immediately. I highly recommend him and his amazing staff to anyone looking for an Allergist.	2
Dr. Kim is great doctor. He listens to your problem and helps comes up with a solution. I have a dog and have allergies to a dog, but getting rid of the dog was not a option, so Dr Kim worked with me and help managed my allergies 	2
"Dr. Kim is the best allergist we've ever had.  My son had a horrible experience at another practice before coming to him.  Since being in his care, his life has changed for the better.  No more nosebleeds, uncontrollable coughing, and crying.  He takes the time to answer all your questions and is very knowledgeable.  The nurses are fantastic and the receptionists are very friendly.  You truly feel cared for at Dr. Kim's.  Everyone is professional and treats you well.
"	2
I've been coming to this practice for years. The staff treats me like I'm family and really cares about my health.  I highly recommend putting your care in their hands.	2
Dr. Kim and his staff are wonderful. We have been receiving treatment there for 3 years now and have never been disappointed. Staff is kind and caring understanding. Hours ar convenient and location is central.  	2
As a patient of Dr Kim's for several years, I can say  definitively that Dr Kim and his entire staff are exceptional.  Dr Kim is very caring and thorough, working to ensure his patients are getting the absolute best treatment for their allergy and asthma ailments as possible.  The office staff are all incredibly friendly, helpful, and thorough, and the office itself is very warm and welcoming, complete with free wifi and TV tuned to either the Food Network or Home and Garden channel.	2
Dr. Kim has worked wonders in managing our son's multiple food allergies, environmental allergies, eczema and asthma. He is extremely thorough and truly makes you feel like he wants you to feel better, not that you are just another patient in the office pipeline. As a parent, I appreciate how he includes my son in his healthcare decision-making. The clinical staff and the front office folks are friendly, helpful, and so helpful, too! In short: Dr. Kim's practice is incredible. 	2
I've been under under Dr. Kim treatment for my allergy for a few years now. Everything is going well so far. 	2
Dr. Kim is great! My initial exam was a very thorough and the range of allergens tested was quite impressive (took up my entire back!). Rather than going straight into recommending allergy shots, he prescribed medication and discussed alternative methods to dealing with my allergies which I appreciated - allergy shots take a lot of commitment. I ended up taking the shots because I was allergic to about everything and his office couldn't be more accommodating - open wait times, amazing staff!	2
"Dr. Kim helps me in many kinds of ways.He makes a few chuckles with the kids and are a all around great guy. from 9yr old patient

Dr. Kim gives his full attention to his patients - explains what he is doing, why and how the patient is effected by their allergies.  Dr. Kim and all his staff are friendly, helpful and attentive.  They are dedicated to the health and wellness of all their patients.  I would recommend Dr. Kim to anyone looking for an allergist."	2
Dr Kim is fantastic. He has an excellent bedside manner. My son has been going to his office for the last year and I recommend anyone I know to go to his office. Dr Kim is great with kids and thorough. He takes the time to explain everything to you and does not seem like he is just out to make a buck off of you. The office staff is excellent too. 20 mins notice and you're in...fantastic! Honestly I can't say enough good things about the nurses, doctors and staff in this office.	2
"Dr. Kim is excellent. Very thorough, friendly and has really helped my son with allergies and Asthma. His staff is also excellent. Very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend this office.
"	2
I never had any issues with him and my treatment has made my allergy and asthma symptoms pretty much go away.	2
I came to Dr. Kim because of allergies. He was kind and caring and very thorough.  He also listened to my concerns. The staff is very kind and helpful. I completed my allergy shots and now go in monthly for maintenance.	2
Very friendly and knowledgeable about my specific case.	2
Dr Judge listened.  He helped in so many ways; really went above and beyond.  He is extremely thoughtful. A broad thinker willing to research my issues. His staff was very kind.  My nurse was absolutely one of the best I have ever had.  Locations are very convenient.  I did not wait long.  Highly recommend.	2
Dr Judge And Team go above and beyond for me to see that I get the knowledge that I need to help control my allergies.They explain the testing that they do and they go over the results in detail.They Inform of me of my next steps in the process of immunizations and how it works and how long it takes for me to start getting relief from the itchy eyes,runny nose,skin itching,breathing through my nose struggles,congestion,and everything else you can think of when I go outside on a daily basis.Dr Judge and  staff is amazing !!	2
It went well.	2
great	2
Dr. Judge is very thorough.  His staff is friendly and competent. I would recommend Allergy, Asthma & Sinus Center to family and friends.	2
I have always found Dr Judge to be very knowledgeable about allergies, but also about the many symptoms and fallout from allergic reactions and living with allergies. He is always willing to explain when I have questions. He is committed to finding the best possible outcome to any upper respiratory malady I come to him with. With much thanks to Dr Judge, my allergies are controlled and have been for many years !	2
I am happy with the methodical approach to gather data around potential allergens and find a culprit for my issue with hives.	2
Very good experience.  Only negative is language difficulty. not bad but slightly difficult to understand.	2
The doctor is willing to take time to explain things and answer questions.	1
Great experience.	2
I have been coming for 2 years.  Starting with the first appointment I have found Dr. Judge and his staff so helpful.  They have answered my questions and concerns.  I have confidence that I have received the very best care.	2
Doctor and nurses are very thorough explaining diagnosis, procedures, and answering questions. Very kind and professional staff.	2
"I've had such strong allergy and stomach problems for years that I just thought I ""had to deal with."" After seeing Dr. Judge, he has really clearly explained what my body is going through and how to start on the road to healing. His staff have been super friendly and great along the way."	2
We have been coming here for the past few years for allergies and shots.   We have always had a good experience. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Always great with listening to any concerns.  Allergy shots are usually quick in and out once your on a routine schedule.  Sometimes waiting on the Dr. to come into the room can be a little long but I wouldn't say it is any different than waiting for any other Dr. appt.  Their busy and have more patients to see than just you.  We like it here.	2
My younger daughter is suffering from a bad allergy and Dr Judge investigated her symptoms, treated a bad sinus infection she had and now we are starting the vaccine allergy treatment, hoping that she will have a better life in the near future	1
My younger daughter has been suffering with severe allergy and he investigated her symptoms deeply and treated her accordingly. Now she is on the allergy vaccines treatment and we hope that in an year she won't have to deal with the bad allergy symptoms anymore	1

The staff here are very helpful and friendly!	2
Dr. Judge is a great allergist who diagnosed and helps me manage my allergy to dust and my asthma.  In addition, he has an amazing staff including Becky who is a magical being when it comes to giving shots without pain.	2
I've seen Dr. Judge since I was a teenager, so we're going on almost two decades now. I feel comfortable in listening to his diagnosis and treatment recommendations, and his management of my chronic conditions has been very good. The nursing and administrative staff in the office are awesome, and are always accommodating with schedule changes, etc.	2

Great experience here and very friendly staff and doctor.  Really great experience and highly recommend this practice.	2
My experience with Dr. Judge has been very positive, especially since he is the first allergist I have made appointments with to mend my allergies and sinus issues. He is a very knowledgeable and friendly doctor who is willing to answer the many questions I had during my first appointment. Overall, I am a very satisfied patient and really eager about the process I've been making regarding my allergy symptoms, thanks to Dr. Judge!	2
very good all the time love my dr	2
very professional	2
I trust the doctor and his staff.  Highly recommend this office.	2
So glad I went with Dr. Judge and did the allergy shots. He got to the underlying issue and not just my symptoms.	2
I'm very happy here with my treatment.	2
Injections have really helped me!	1
Dr. Judge and his staff are amazing! I am so pleased with my experience here! I highly recommend here! I've learned so much about myself and he takes the time to explain everything to me. The staff are always so kind and helpful. I couldn't ask for a better place. Thank you all!	2
I came in with allergy symptoms of a runny stuffy nose 24/7 I got tested and they made a serum just for my symptoms and I don't have allergies as bad now. The entire staff team is very nice and respectful.	2
I couldn't imagine not itching, it's like a miracle that he was able to stop my itching. I am totally satisfied, and I would recommend Dr.Judge to anyone.	2
staff was wonderful	2

He helped with me and my daughter and has been nothing but great to us	2
Dr. Judge cares about allergies, where they come from and long term and easy solutions. Grateful	2
Since the first time I came to see Dr. Judge, him and his staff have been helpful and wonderful.  Me and my health are in great hands at this office.  Love them!!	2
I have been seeing Dr. Judge for 18 years to treat my allergies and allergy symptoms.	1
Never had any issues Dr. and staff are very professional. They answer all the questions I have. Treatment is effective. Highly recommended for anyone suffering from allergies.	2
Questionable billing practices.	0
The staff is very friendly and clear. The doctor explains treatments well and works well with insurance.	2
Dr Judge listens well and gently encourages me to use medications.  His office is very organized and staff are always friendly and respectful.	2
When moving to Cary from Atlanta, I discovered that the 2500 pollen count in Atlanta was nothing compared to the nightmare here in the City of Oaks.  Dr. Judge diagnosed the 80+ things I was allergic to and recommended that I get on immunotherapy.  Although apprehensive, I decided to go for it and as time has passed, my symptoms continue to subside.  He and the staff genuinely listens to his patients and their needs.  I have recommended his services to many friends and will continue to do so.   	2
I can't even fathom giving this person even .01 of a star! Never in my life have I seen a professional not only have NO respect for his patients time, but he has NO respect for his staff, then wonders why the turn over rate is so HIGH! Always a new face when you walk in the door and they must have been poorly trained because they know nothing!  He belittles and degrades his staff, funny thing he must think that ppl can't hear him. He should not have a business and everyone should run far away!	0
Very kind and attentive doctor.  I have a lot of confidence in his recommendations and he takes the time to explain things.  I feel that he really cares about his patients.	2
"This is not a medicine practiceit is a sales company just worried about your money. 

Was there for an allergy issue, they performed all kinds of tests without explaining costs and insurances policies about it, at the end they charged me $750 for the tests.

Also, they tried to sell me a vaccine treatment that would cost thousands. 

I would stay away from this clinic."	0
Wealth of experience, my children and I have been coming here for years.	2
"I scheduled an appointment with the DOCTOR, but instead, ended up seeing his NP.  
I was CHARGED for the services of a doctor, but saw someone with less than half of the education and training of a medical doctor."	0
Always have a wonderful experience here. Staff is absolutely fabulous	2
Great results!!	2
The best ever!	2
I'm moving to Nottingham, and will be changing all my medical providers... except Dr. Mardiney. That's how awesome a doctor he is.	2
Always a good experience with Dr. Mardiney - very personable and knowledgeable.  Haven't had major issues with allergies since being treated here.	2
great office and doctor!	2
jacob went from being sick and allergic as a child to a strong healthy active college freshman because of the care and carinf treatment by Dr Mardiney	2
Phenomenal.  The epitome of what a perfect doctor should be.  Front office is wonderful.  The business operates like a well-oiled-machine.  Thank you.	2
He listens to what we have to say and our concerns.	1
"always willing to find solution to asthma

Dr.Mardiney always goes above and beyond for my family	2
Dr. Mardiney has excellent bed side manner. Got to the root of my problem and has turned my life around. Have been with him since 2000 with no intention of leaving.	2
"I Love Dr Mardiney!!!!
He and Kayla (his nurse practitioner)
are soo helpful. I am a music teacher and use my voice all day long and have had severe sinus problems my entire life. When my ENT retired, I showed up at Dr Mardiney’s office and he immediately helped me. He listens to me and clearly wants to help me get better. 
I have recommended all my friends to this practice and he now sees my entire family!! I can’t say enough good things about the treatment I get from Dr. Mardiney and his team!"	2
easy,fast,Awesome	2
"i had a cough for about 25 years and he found the cure.  i was on prednisone at least 4 time a year. I feel so much better now.  i have not been on prednisone for a year.
Thank you"	2
the best	2
All of my questions were answered thoroughly.  It was very refreshing.  Took all the time I needed.  Felt very well treated and I as though all my concerns were bona fide.  Great experience all around.  Excellent staff.	2
"I have been going to Dr Matthew Mardiney for the last ten years and have been completely satisfied with his care and staff.
When I first came to Dr Matthew Mardiney, I was suffering from so many seasonal allergies and asthma that I could hardly breathe.
Dr Matthew Mardiney put me on the right medications.....explaining everything he was trying to accomplish with my conditions. He is calm, understanding, a good diagnostician, and a good listener and has always kept me informed along the way."	2
I've had 6 major surgeries; been seen by dozens of specialists; and Doctor Mardinay is simply one of the best.  I suffered with an ailment, that other doctors failed to cure, for 2 years before having the good fortune of being referred to Doctor Mardinay.  I'm so grateful.	2
Excellent!	2
Dr. Mardiney is patient and listens to his patients concerns.	1
I have never had a doctor follow-up and respond as quickly as Dr. Mardiney.	1
We love Dr. Matthew he has treated my kids for years!!	2
knows your stuff I appreciate it	2
I suffered for years from various allergies.  I was not able to be outdoors for any length of time.  A Friend recommended Dr. Mardiney and after a few visits I am able to enjoy the outdoors again.  Dr.  Mardiney is a Godsend.  Ashley and Tonya are amazing.  His staff in Bel Air are the best	2
Dr. Mardiney is attentive, available and thorough.  He personally ensures each of his patients is well take care of and is extremely knowledgeable about allergies and asthma.  As a lifelong asthmatic, I have never known life could be so controlled!! Thank you Dr. Mardiney!!	2
Dr. Martiney is a very good listener and understand all you are felling and is very compassionate about his job. He is a tremendous help in dealing with all your Asthma and Alergiy concerns.	2
Dr. Mardiney is a good listener and always considers the details we give in order to give the best medication.  We always recommend him to everyone!	2
my asthma has improved	1
very good and to the point	2
I have severe allergies and asthma. Coming to see Dr.Mardiney was the best decision I've made, he got everything under control within the first weeks of my first visit. His staff is so friendly and personable. Thank you to everyone at Advanced Allergies and Asthma!	2
the best care !!!!	2
IT was ok since my arms still will hurt	1
Dr. Mardiney always listens and makes me feel comfortable as a patient.	2
If you want to be fully heard and supported by a really smart and personable physician who can and will help you even beyond what you though possible  - Dr. Mardiney is the doctor for you.  Add in the wonderful attentive team who make you feel like family.  I really love them and my health has absolutely improved by leaps and bounds compared to my last allergist.  I have learned a great deal, have gained a lot of relief, and I just cannot recommend more highly.	2
Dr. Mardiney is a very nice and caring doctor. He really takes the time to listen to what is going on and how I am feeling to prepare a plan to get me feeling better!	2
would suggest family members to come and be seen. thanks to michele and krsitie for helping me and maycee at the front desk	2
He is patient and listens to you. Very caring and always available	2
good bedside manor, quick with office visits, pays close attention to the patient.	2
I think that he is a really good doctor and I always trust him and I think Cindy and Tonya are your best workers here and you better make sure not to fire her. I will always come here because I think that the stuff you are doing is working because my son and I really enjoy this and we think that it is working.	2
Dr. Mardiney is the most attentive and caring doctor I have been to!	2
This office is wonderful. Dr.  M and his staff ROCKS	2
I first saw the other Dr. Mardiney.  Two visits with him was all I could stand.  Found wonderful reviews about his brother.  Instantly made an appointment and finally received results!  Wonderful Doctor!!	2
Doctor Mardiney is the most caring and competent physician I have ever met.  It is obvious he cares about each and every one of his patients and he works hard to insure that they are doing well.  It is easy to keep in touch with him and ask questions.   I would recommend  him to anyone!	2
I recently started getting allergy shots with Dr Matthew Mardiney in Lutherville.  I had been a patient of Dr. John Bacon, who retired in 2016.  I thought I could go without shots, but after a year and a half of sinus infections I knew I needed a new doctor.  Dr Matthew Mardiney was recommended.  I have found Dr Mardiney and his staff to be knowledgeable, friendly and organized.  All staff members are terrific.  Glad I found this practice!  I highly recommend. 	2
I've never met a doctor like Dr. Mardiney, he genuinely cares about his patients and goes the extra mile.  He takes his time with you so you are not feeling rushed, he answers all of your questions and ask that you give him feedback as to how your treatment is going. IF you're looking for an allergist look no further you found the best with Dr. Mardiney, I suffered for years with allergies and eczema and he has been the only one that has succeeded in treating me. His office staff is  top-notch.	2
I have been seeing Dr Mardiney for many years, and can honestly say that my quality of life would not exist, except for his excellent diagnostic abilities, and great care.  I recommend him to anyone who asks for an allergist!	2
Dr. Matthew Mardiney is the doctor you want to have. Dr. Mardiney has been my allergist for over 15 years. He has treated my youngest son and husband as well. If there is a health concern, Dr. Mardiney will not shrug his shoulders, say he doesn’t know, limit it to his specialty nor dismiss you; he keeps trying to figure the puzzle out. I would highly recommend Dr. Matthew Mardiney. 	2
Timely, patiently answered all of my questions, gave a thorough exam followed by testing and explained all results.  Am now following his advise as to treatment.	2
He was very kind and extremely thorough at my first visit.	2
Unfortunately, I have to have many doctors attending to my many health problems. Of all the doctors that have treated me in New York, Atlanta, and Tampa, Dr.Parrino has to be counted as one of the best doctors I have ever seen. For my most recent health problem, I was exasperated after seeing a half dozen doctors. Dr. Parrino solved my problem which had lingered for 6 months. Not only is the man competent but he is extremely personable. You cannot help but like the man.	2
Dr. Jack is without question the most patient and thorough doctors I have ever been to. He takes all the time necessary to understand your problem and figure out the best course of action. I had a severe side effect from an antibiotic I was taking, and he helped me determine which other antibiotics I could take without having to worry about allergic reactions. Also, you always leave the office with a complete written summary of your visit, which is very helpful as you forget details over time.	2
Dr. Parrino is probably the best doctor you'll ever see. He is like a detective when trying to find out what's wrong with you. If you have an ailment, he will do all he can to find out what it is. He is very concerned, caring and I would highly recommend him.	2
Dr. Parrino is an incredible physician. I went to him due to prolonged, repeated sickness. The first visit he spent over 3 hours with me getting to know me and my medical history. An allergy test was recommended and performed. Since my diagnosis with specific allergies and treatment, I have been feeling better than I have in a very long time. I give thanks to Dr. Parrino for this. The staff is wonderful as well. I highly recommend Dr. Parrino to anyone in search of an allergist/immunologist. 	2
Dr. Parrino is the best.  He has been my allergist for many years and has always diagnosed & treated any illness accurately and expeditiously.  Recently after seeing my PCP and several other MD's for a respiratory infection which would not resolve Dr.Parrino got it right the first time and I am well and back to work thanks to him. I would recommend him to anyone.  Thank-you Dr.Parrino for many years of health.  Do not retire!  Sincerely,  Rita E.	2
I have been very satisfied with my health care from Dr. Parrino for more than 10 years now. He actually takes the time to learn about my health, regardless of whether my issues relate directly to my allergies. He listens and considers the whole person; not just the allergies. He is extremely well informed about allergy treatments and medications and understands how those work with other prescriptions, too. 	2
Dr. Parrino is an incredible physician who truly cares about his patients. I went to him with some very unusual symptoms, and he spent a total of 4.5 hours with me trying to diagnose my issues and find solutions. I thought doctors like this no longer existed, and I was extremely pleased with his level of care. My husband had seen him and recommended that I see him, but he far exceeded my expectations. He is one of the good ones!	2
I was looking to get an appointment with an Allergist and saw Dr.Parrino was highly recommended by others. When I called his office his front office staff was friendly, and genuinely cared to help me get in to be seen. She scheduled me out for a week or two, but then a few hours she called me back as she had a cancellation sooner! Dr. Parrino was very thorough and seems to genuinely care. Its a pleasure walking into this type of practice opposed to practice's that treat you like a number. 	2
"Doc was good, but watch your money! 112 days & no refund yet of overpayment of $149. I'm tired of excuses. The insurance EOB came a WEEK after the appt! Where's the refund?  Excuses: ""Oh, it was mailed Tuesday, we had a change of our system"" - prior it was ""it is our policy to take 30-45 days to process that."" Asked why, ""oh, our accountant is offsite""  when pressed it was ""well sometimes she runs out of checks & we have to send her some"". Ridiculous!  Long wait times at appt. freezing office"	0
He is great, makes you feel like he cares!	2
What can I say, Dr. Hurwitz is a mensch. He really does care about the well-being of his patients. His knowledge base it packed with years of experience and a long list of accolades along the way.	2
"Dr. Kaplan is an experienced, knowledgeable and dedicated physician who takes the time to listen to the patients concerns and asks the right questions to do a logical analysis of the patients needs. He is determined to identify the proper medications to treat the patients symptoms. I've been seeing Dr. Kaplan for over a year and he has identified the root cause for my condition and the proper medications necessary to offer me a better way of life. His entire staff is comforting and enjoyable to work with and the office environment is family oriented. I would call Dr. Kaplan the ""King"" of the Asthma doctors."	2
This is an awsome doctor. He did what 15 dermatologist couldn't do in  over 15 years  which was clear up my skin condition. It was very bad sores all over my body. Thank God for this man. God bless you doctor Kaplan.	2
"I have been a patient of Dr. mark Kaplan for the last 10 - 12 years. I would like to take this opportunity to recommend Dr. Kaplan to anyone who is searching for a physician that is a top notch professional.
Dr. Kaplan is enthusiastic, competent, and thorough in his gathering of patient information; which he uses to make his determination and presents it to you in a way that is easily understood.  He is geniuly concerned for your health as well as compassionate.
His entire staff is excellent!"	2
Dr Kaplan is a very professional doctor who listens, analyzes your condition  and takes a sincere interest in helping one to regain a better quality of life.  He is available for questions and I never feel he is rushing to finish with me and move on.... a quality hard to find in physicians today   His always friendly manner puts you at ease and you know at once that he sincerely wants to successfully treat your condition .  I highly recommend him.	2
Very concern in my condition.  Listens to all I have to say and has excellent recommendations.  He has a very friendly office with all friendly and nice nurses  and doctors.  Never have any trouble calling and asking questions when needed.	2
I highly recommend Dr. Kaplan to anybody in need of an excellent Asthma & Allergy specialist. I’ve been seeing Dr. Kaplan for my Asthma & Allergy symptoms for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. Dr. Kaplan takes the time to listen and observe, which is important since Asthma & Allergies are long term conditions that need to be monitored and treatment plans always need adjusting. My allergies are also linked to sinus polyps and even though in the past I had been seeing a dedicated Ear	2
"Dr. Kaplan has been my allergist for 10 years.  I have had the best care any Dr. in his specialty, could ask for.  I am one of those difficult patients, and he has stood by me, always attentive to my health issues, sending me to other Dr.'s to cover all issues that may attribute to this asthma.

"	2
My daughters started seeing dr Kaplan in 1992 at 7 and 10 and are still his patients. He is a knowledgeable, caring and warm Doctor. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great allergist!!!	2
There are not enough words to express how wonderful Dr. Kaplan is as a person and a doctor.  My family and I have gone to him since I was 11 and he is one of the few doctors I actually look forward to going to see!  He is friendly, kind and one of the most helpful doctors I have ever had.  It is tough to find a doctor these days that has wonderful bedside manner like he does.  I can't recommend him and his practice enough!	2
We've seen him for over ten years for food and environmental allergies, as well as asthma.  He is an excellent doctor who works well with his team of staff members.  He cares for his patients and alwYs makes time to see kids when they are having trouble.  My eldest daughter was treated with allergy shots because medication was not enough to manage her allergies and asthma.  She missed weeks of kindergarten and first grade.  Now as at almost 17, she only needs an inhaler a couple times a year.  	2
After years of suffering, myself and my 3 kids have finally found relief! For years we were told my kids had allergies and were put on several allergy medicines, with no relief and constant issues. Dr. Kaplan, with time, knowledge and devotion has figured out my kids had asthma and allergies related to asthma, and finally got me to be able to go outside again! It truly changed our lives! The staff at the office is absolutely amazing! I have never been so happy walking into a Dr.'s office! 	2
Dr. Kaplan and his staff are all excellent, very kind and efficient. I am always called into an exam room minutes upon arrival, I am always greeted with a smile and I have confidence in Dr. Kaplan's ability in treating me. 	2
Dr Ahmad is not only incredibly knowledgeable about allergies and asthma but he is holistic in his approach. He will use every tool available to make sure my asthma is under control. Also he will tell you like it is which I really appreciate. He is very personable and spends a lot of time with you.	2
I was able to get in quickly when I was miserable! I was very impressed by the staff's friendliness and the Doctor's sincere care and knowledge of my ailment.  I have felt much better since following his recommendations. 	2
I was not terribly impressed with this doctor. He seemed very dismissive and did not explain things well at all - I was better off researching my medical concerns online. 	0
Dr. Majmudar is compassionate, a clinical expert, and cares about her patients.  I am complex patient and also a medical professional. She uses her knowledge, experience, and understanding to manage complex cases and think outside of the box.  Dr. Majmudar is an asset to her profession.	2
If you’re a complex case, this is not your doctor. 	1
She is AMAZING!!!!!! She cares about her patients.	2
She really cares, she is not just doing her job. Love her	2
Dr Majmudar was absolutely wonderful.  . I was a difficult case, she took her time with me and very kind.  She even saw me when I was having a difficult time with hives without an appointment.  I would highly recomend her,  	2
"Dr. Tuffiash is extremely knowledgeable, very friendly and answers any questions you may have.  He explains things thoroughly.
His staff is also free pleasant and caring.
Thank you,
Mikki Homolash"	2
Dr. Rohr sincerely CARES about his patients and LISTENS to their concerns. Always has recall of past medical problems and explores appropriate treatment. I have been seeing Dr. Rohr for 25+ years and even though I now live in a different state, I travel to his office for EXPERT care.	2
Great doc!  Do not hesitate to call Dr. Rohr!	2
Dr Richard Harris is a GREAT doctor!  I have been to him myself and I send a lot of our guests to him ( I am in the hotel business)  Thank you Dr. Harris!	2
This physician is highly competent and compassionate.  I've undergone allergy immunization for over ten years.  Prior to the shots, my asthma was volatile but now it's stable.  I feel much better under his care.	2
"Dr. Micheal King is an excellent Doctor who listened carefully and tested me for airborne allergy’s.

His approach and personality’s remains just what I hoped for ."	2
"Kind, caring and thorough. Dr. Lyons is a think outside the box Doc and he gets results. He ran tests that other doctors never did and found three major problems that other doctors couldn't. 
I absolutely love this guy, he's my favorite Doc ever!
"	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Lyons since the late 90's, and it is hard to believe you are being guided by a friend who is a Doctor. Dr. Lyons is the most caring Doctor I have been under the care of. His compassion is 2nd to none, and his knowledge is superior as he will not quit until he finds answers. But I would bet he always has the answers because he has dedicated his life to medicine, his patients, and research. Thank God for Dr. Lyons!	2
I like that he doesn't think he knows everything. He seems to realize that just because he can't explain something, doesn't mean it doesn't exist/happen. Plus, even if he can't explain it he'll look in to it (order tests, etc). I like that he'll order tests and tell you which are most important, and which are really expensive and can wait. He is also incredibly supportive of diet changes - he preaches that in fact. He will help you figure out what you can eat, and tell you what you shouldn't.  	2
Dr. Lyons is one of the most kind and caring doctors I know, easy to talk to and listens with concern. Makes you feel at ease especially before a procedure. Would highly recommend him to any family or friends.	2
Dr. Lyons is very intelligent, compassionate, and empathetic. I would recommend him to anyone needing a gastroenterologist.	2
Dr. Kossoff has been my gastroenterologist for over 1o years. As a  retired nurse, I find him and his entire staff to be very professional, yet caring. I have several issues that need to be treated and I find they are there whenever I need them. When you meet with them, they take as much time as you need , so you fully understand what is going on. I would highly recommend he, and his staff to anyone. In fact, my family members are also their patients!	2
"• Knowledgeable
• Addresses the person as a whole, & not just the symptoms
• Reassuring"	2
Dr. Kossoff and his team have been my doctor for several years always showing personal concern to go the extra mile and be available when diagnosing my health issue to ensure a speedy recovery.	2
I recently had a colonoscopy that went well.  But the heart monitoring as part of the procedure showed issues with my heart.  At the 3 week follow up after the colonoscopy, Dr. Kossoff was concerned that my appointment with a cardiologist had been pushed out to 2 weeks in the future.  He was concerned that my heart rate was elevated.  He called a nearby cardiologist and I was seen the same day.  I appreciate the extra time Dr. Kossoff spent at the follow up.  It could turn out more important than the colonoscopy itself.	2
He has terrible bedside manner. I felt he did not explain my diagnosis to me in detail and left feeling very disappointed. I would not recommend him.	0
"Dr. Kossoff is by far the best gastroenterologist in the Frederick area - and maybe the entire State of Maryland. He has the awards in his office to prove it! I’ve been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for over 8 years, while residing in different locations that are at minimum 50 miles away from his Frederick, MD office. However, Dr. Kossoff’s professionalism, attention to detail and care, along with his affability has made me want to keep Dr. Kossoff as my GI doctor for my Crohn’s Disease without hesitation, no matter my zip code. 
 
 "	2
Dr. Kossoff and his entire staff are highly professional, and more importantly are very attentive to my health issues.  Dr. Kossoff is always available to answers my questions and very concerned about my overall health.  I would recommend anyone needing a gastroenterologist and specialized care (e.g., colitis, IBS, etc.) call Dr. Kossoff and his 1st class staff.	2
"You will walk into a clean, friendly, comfortable lobby for the Dr. Kossof office on Thomas Jefferson Drive.  The front desk were organized and the team in the back at checkout were very helpful too.  
When I am with Dr. Kossoff, I feel that he gives me all of the time needed to finish a proper, thorough visit.   The attention and time they gave me is priceless and he answers all of our questions and the communications by all the team is excellent too.  You should go here for your GI needs. "	2
I had a fantastic experience with Dr. Kossoff and his team. I was having gallbladder pain over a long holiday weekend. I called first thing Monday and they got me in later that same day. After hearing my story, they ordered me blood work and an ultra sound STAT through FMH Rosehill. After receiving my results, Dr. Kossoff stopped at nothing to get in touch with me that night. I was already asleep and when he couldn't reach me, he called my husband several times until he answered. My numbers were	2
Overall excellent practice. Always prompt, very thorough. Dr. Kossoff has been my GI doc for over 20 years. The colonoscopy procedure is painless. The offices and surgical center are top notch. I highly recommend Dr Kossoff and his team.	2
Dr. Kossoff is great!	2
I have been a patient of Dr Kossoff since 2005 - I am 54 years old. He diagnosed my Barrett’s Esophagus and also addressed colon issues I’ve had.  Dr Kossoff has done SIX EGD’s and FOUR colonoscopies on me - and I have to say, I have never trusted or respected a doctor as much as I do him. He has an amazingly relaxed and confident manner that makes for easy and open conversation about awkward conditions.  Best doctor I’ve ever had. I’ve moved out of state, but I will travel to keep seeing him.	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for many years now, having first visited him with issues that were a result of gastro difficulties, and a surgical procedure that was collapsing. He examined, tested and scoped me with the eventual analysis that I would need a repair to the surgery from some years before, however nobody in our area was skilled in that respect. I received a phone call from Dr. K some time later and he informed me that a specialist was available to whom he was going to refer me. 	1
I have been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for many years.  This practice is professional, caring and compassionate.  He spends as much time as needed with each patient so that when you leave the office you understand what needs to be done and why.  I credit Dr. Kossoff and Lindsay, NP with saving my life due to a CT scan that found a mass that turned out to be cancer.  I would not go to any other GI.  	2
Very honest,professional love the entire staff	2
Dr. Kossoff spent a great deal of time listening to all symptoms and answering all of our questions and concerns. We would recommend him to anyone having digestive issues!! Very thourough and genuinely wants to make his patients better.....	2
I see Dr. Kossoff for a chronic issue.  He was recommended as a premier doctor for this issue and he has helped me manage it very well.  I see him every visit, and he is helpful, thorough, and attentive.  After my visits, I know where I stand, what I need to do, what to watch for, and what to expect next.  Decisions are mine, no pressure, just strong recommendations.  I am out of state and his office works with me to make things happen when I travel for my visits or call with questions.	2
"I felt like I was rushed, not listened to, and I have had unsuccessful procedures before, so I really needed him to listen to me. He stared at the computer screen and didn't listen. ... after I waited an hour past my appointment time. and then waited two more times to check out. The ""assistant"" who took my history was abrupt and bossy. The whole attitude of the office was very negative. I am deciding if I want to go through with him for my colonscopy and gi series,"	0
Friendly and explained everything. Wonderful staff and great care before and after.	2
Dr. Kossoff and his entire staff are fantastic! I've been going to this practice for almost 10 years and I've always felt I had the best care possible.  Dr. Kossoff and his staff always put their customers ahead of everything!	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Kossoff’s for almost 20 years now and I would not trust my GI health to anyone else. He is very knowledgeable in his field. He is also very personable and delicate when discussing difficult issues. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a GI in Frederick. 	2
"have been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for several years and have been very happy with the care I’ve received from him. He’s very caring, puts his patients at ease with his sense of humor, and always takes his time with each appointment, never making you feel rushed. I have recommended him to others in search of a gastroenterologist and will continue to do so.
My blood levels were elevated very high for pancreatitis, he call me on NYE and was very concerned and sent me to get blood work ASAP "	2
I have been Dr. Kossoff's patient for the last 5 years. I am extremely satisfied with the professionalism, courtesy and care that he and his staff provide. On occasion, he has called me at home at night to follow up on progress or status of my health. The medications and referrals he has provided to address my condition was very successful, improved my symptoms and now I am pain free. I would be happy to recommend Dr. Kossoff to anyone who is in need of a Gastroenterologist. 	2
I have been completely satisfied with the care I have received from Dr. Kossoff and his associates.  I have been under Dr. Kossoff's care for the past 10 years, and he has been extremely focused on my treatment and making the necessary adjustments in a well explained, thought out manner.  I never feel rushed during my office visits and Dr. Kossoff always takes the necessary time to explain test results and details about my treatment.  I strongly recommend Dr. Kossoff for gastroenterology care.	2
I went to Dr. Kossoff after receiving two different diagnosis from two previous doctors.  He has staffed his office with extremely kind, compassionate and professional people.  From the first time he walked into our first meeting, I felt comfortable and knew that he was going to figure out what was wrong with me and get me on a path to recovery.  I was right!  I have been correctly diagnosed and have been medicated correctly and have almost no symptoms of my issues.  HIGHLY recommend him!!	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for several years and have been very happy with the care I’ve received from him.

Very thorough and precise.  Highly recommend!!	2
"During my time under Dr. Kossoff's ""care"", I have been told less useful information than I could have found on Google myself. I have spent money and time listening to him restate information that was entirely obvious and tell me that my symptoms/side effects essentially could not possibly be legitimate. Of course most of the time was spent just waiting, as all of my actual appointments have lasted less than 5 minutes. It is clear that I know by body better than Dr. Kossoff knows his practice. "	0
My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Kossoff for many years. When I first met Dr. Kossoff, he introduced himself as “Dr. Kossoff, like Kiss-off but with an “O”.”  My husband and I busted out laughing.  We love his sense of humor.  I have to thank Dr. Kossoff for saving my husband’s life 12 years ago.  My husband was in his early 40’s and had cancerous polyps that were caught early and removed.  If these were not caught early, my husband would not be with me today.  I have great confidence 	2
Danger Alert! Stay Away! I had severe ulcerative colitis when I saw this doctor. All he did was give me one blood test. No medication given. After the one office visit my insurance paid for the visit. After getting payment, the doctors office ruined my credit rating for seven years by saying I did not pay. There are many other quality gastroenterologists in the Frederick area.	0
I have been a patient of Dr. Kossoff's for more than ten years and would be absolutely lost without him. Dr Kossoff has literally saved my life and continues to keep me healthy no matter where in the world I happen to find myself. While deployed to the Middle East, Dr. Kossoff made absolutely sure I could reach him and his wonderful staff for an emergency question or prescription refill. He cares deeply for every patient and his staff is the nicest and most professional I have ever encountered. 	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for many years.  He has always been highly professional and extremely caring.  He takes the time to work with you through the diagnosis and provides you with results and treatments that is easily understood and thorough in detail. I have total confidence in his work as a physician.  I have recommended him to others and everyone is very pleased with his approach, knowledge and patient care. I would highly recommend him to anyone. His staff is excellent!	2
I love him. Have gone to Dr. Kossoff for over 10 years. Wouldn't see any other doctor. 	2
I have been a patient for 5 yrs.  He's the best; I can't imagine going anywhere else.  I'm well taken care of, & office visits are not rushed.	2
Dr. Kossoff is hands down my favorite doctor.  I have been to him for multiple issues over the course of several years.  He explains things in a manner that is so understandable.  He instantly puts you at ease and makes you feel like you no longer need to worry - he's going to fix you right up.  And you know what?  He does!  Every single time.  He is hilarious and wicked smart!  The total package you want in a doctor - great bedside manner and a brilliant mind.  	2
Dr. Kossoff saved my wife's life 15 years ago when he diagnosed an abnormality in her large and small intestine. Since that time he has been her gastroenterologist.  He is extremely skilled and has an excellent bedside manner.  He intently listens to the patient in order to understand the state of the patient and makes sure that the patient understands any diagnosis or proposed treatment.  He and his staff are friendly and respect the patient's time.  We highly recommend Dr. Kossoff.	2
I’ve seen Dr. Kossoff several times my initial visit was to rule out anemia with unknown etiology.  Dr. Kossoff could’ve easily assumed everything was fine after he performed my procedure instead, he took the time to rule out another possibility which was instrumental in me getting much-needed treatment. Dr. Kossoff is caring and professional.  The staff is also excellent.  I am very satisfied with the care I receive.  	2
"Dr. Kossoff was great!  He did an excellent job diagnosing my GI issues and set out a plan to resolve my problems.   I have progressed to the point were I no longer have symptoms.  

His office environment is excellent.  Staff are helpful and he is on time.  "	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Kossoff for years now and there is no other Dr. that I respect or believe in more than him. He is a straight shooter and isn't afraid to tell you what's going on. He and his staff are kind arena professional.	2
"DONT go to David Kossoff!  He is in it for the insurance aspect and will test you to death but NEVER give results!!!  My daughter has suffered a year under his ""care"".  We've FINALLY went elsewhere.  Kossoff is NOT to be trusted."	0
Dr. Kossoff is a great doctor.   He listens to what is going on and has gotten my health back on track.  	2
I first met Dr. Kossoff ten years ago and I have only the highest recommendation for him and his staff.   I have been treated with a kind and caring attitude by everyone I've met.	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Kossoff.  His level of care, compassion and expertise is second to none.  Everything was handled in an extremely efficient manner.  	2
Dr Kossoff exhibited extreme concern for my symptoms. Recommend him completely.	2
Dr. Kossoff is the first doctor in the area who heard my symptoms and then actually did tests and figured out what was going on with my stomach. I've had a lot of doctors blow me off and say it was just acid reflux but he actually figured out what was wrong within a few visits and a couple of tests. Would 100% recommend to friends and family. Not only is he great, but his PA is as well and interested in patient care and they communicate well so I didn't feel like I had the same visit twice.	2
"I love Dr. Kossoff and his amazing staff.  I would highly recommend. They are caring and very professional.  Trust me when I say "" They are all about the patient""  You matter to them and they take care of you like you are their family.  I am grateful to Dr Kossoff for fixing and keeping a careful watch on my conditions.   Thank you again. They are amazing.  Keep up the excellent care."	2
Started out great he seemed engaged and working my issue.  But then he pawned me off on his PA, and they botched medications multiple times, wrong one, wrong dose, too little so it ran out and on and on.  Then condition I saw him far came back and worse, in extreme pain call and can't see him until 5 weeks later?  Crazy poor business.  Didn't fix the problem, not interested evidently with a pawn off to a PA...not there when you need him.  Grabbed my records and moved on.  High hopes here...poor 	0
I went into the office very upset and sick, and I was treated very poorly by the staff and doctor.  I was scheduled for an endoscopy after 2 minutes of Dr Kossoff coming in, not speaking with me, pressing on my stomach with no explanation.  I left more upset and confused.  After my endoscopy Dr Kossoff did not speak with me, and only to my mother even though she was not on any release and I was in my late twenties.  I will never go back.  No bedside manner or respect.	0
Dr. Kossoff always goes above and beyond to offer you the best care possible.  His office staff is excellent and when we call we don't wait and a professional and polite person answers the phone.  Dr. Kossoff has both experience and empathy, a rare combination these days.  Because of Dr. Kossoff my husband was diagnosed early with pancreatic cancer, and he has a chance to survive it!!	2
Dr. Kossoff was very professional and treated me with kindness and concern.  He put my safety and well-being first.  He didn't just rush in and treat when he saw an area of concern.  He referred me to a specialist and then that specialist sent me back to him.  He made a plan that was well thought through and it airs on the side of caution.  I feel fortunate to have been referred to Dr. Kossoff.  I know I am in a doctor's hands that is truly about helping and healing.  	2
Both my boyfriend and I happen to be in need of a Gastroenterologist just a few months of each other.  He used Dr. Patel first and was extremely satisfied and I went to all his visits with Dr. Patel and was able to sit in and experience them with him.  That is why I decided to use Dr. Patel also and again extremely satisfied.  He is kind, caring and keeps on top of everything going on in his office.  I had to call after hours with a concern and he called back with kindness and quickly put me at ease unlike some experiences I have have through the years with doctors being a bit annoyed.   WE highly recommend Dr. Patel.	2
I came to Dr.Patel and ARNP with a list of complaints. Dr. Patel and his staff worked quickly to get a plan of care together. They were all so helpful and kind during the whole testing process. I would highly recommend them for all GI needs!	2
Horrible, rude, dismissive and checking email or vm while patient is asking questions/talking vs being attentive or concerned. I can't say this enough ...don't use him. Office is crazy, make mistakes and confused about everything and snippy. Dr P seems to schedule tests and appt so as to benefit payments vs health issues. Most important he says very hurtful rude things to patient who are there for help. What doctor does that? Just horrible doctor! There are others in the area that far exceed his lack of knowledge and personality flaws.	0
a good experience.	2
Staff is very friendly and efficient. Dr. Patel is extremely professional and explains everything to the patient. I would highly recommend him and his staff.	2
second time here and everyone has been very respectful and caring!	2
the dr was extremly friendly and explained everthing in detail.	2
I wish I could give some dr. Patel more than five stars. He is an outstanding doctor that truly is compassionate and cares about the well-being of his patients and I haven't seen that in so long it was refreshing!!!	2
Dr. patels staff is fantastic and the office is clean and organized. Dr.Patel is great at explaining things to his patient.	2
Dr. Patel is very thorough and patient. He listens and is very compassionate. I've been with Dr Patel for over two years and feel blessed to have found this doctor.	2
great	2
Best Dr I have had. He has done so much to help me! Thank you.	2
Dr.Patel has been a wonderful doctor to me. Listens well and is very kind.	2
"I've been to doctor Patel 6 times, once for my colonoscopy. He diagnosed me with Ulcerative Colitis, gave me 2 medicines ""for the rest of my life"" and sent me on my way. One of the medicines he gave me worked, but now he refuses to re-prescribe it. I've been suffering for two months without this medication. I've called his office numerous times asking him to please refill it, but he is always ""out of the office or doing surgery"". If you have a chronic illness, do not go to doctor Patel."	0
Dr  Patel has worked with me to alleviate digestive issues  He performed a colonoscopy and referred me to a therapist to help with issues.	1
Dr. Patel is compassionate, knowledgeable, patient, a good listener. His office team is kind, responsive runs on time. Excellent GI.	2
great	2
Very professional doctor he explains everything well, very kind.  I have had a positive experience with him he's great!	2
good doctor	2
made me feel very comfortable and helped with my situation	2
very good	2
Dr. Patel and his staff were very friendly,  knowledgeable and helpful. I had a very good experience and wouldn't hesitate referring him to my friends.	2
Dr. Patel is great at explaining things related to procedures, diagnosis and care.  I'm happy that I found him, and will continue to see him for my GI health.	2
I found Dr. Patel to be very willing to listen to me before making any kind of diagnosis. His office staff was very polite and helpful. I would certainly recommend Dr. Patel to anyone and everyone looking for a very knowledgeable and compassionate  Dr.	2
very caring and listened to me, tried to help me find the best solution to my problems.	2
Dr. Patel has the worst bedside manner. He is rude and does not explain things. He also does not listen to his patients	0
"I had Colon cancer and Dr Patel removed it as it was in a pollop (not sure how you spell that word) He was so happy for me and he explained everything i needed to know. I have 100% trust in this man. He has done a couple of procedures on me and i am very satisfied! 
Thank you"	2
He is the best Dr I have ever seen. He explains carefully and has a great interest in the patient. His advice is perfect and he is not an alarmist. Thank you Dr Patel. 	2
Bedside  manner:  Condescending, RUDE, bad attitude, demeans patient.   Doesn't deserve one star.	0
Everything Dr Patel has discussed with me thus far has proven to be accurate and I'm satisfied with the results thus far.  The staff has been helpful as well.	2
Does not listen. He is also very difficult to understand and when you ask him to repeat it, he gets visibly annoyed and just says it faster.  I waited almost 24 hours in an acute care facility to see him and when I did he spent 15 minutes and could not wait to leave. This was also late at night, so it was obvious he was annoyed.  Bedside manner is awful. 	0
I've been seeing Dr Patel for almost a year now.  I had undiagnosed abdominal pain that my primary doctor couldn't figure out.  Dr Patel was able to help me and I have been pain free for over 6 months now.  He is kind, listens well, his staff is organized and courteous, and I have no qualms about recommending him to anyone who need a GI doctor.	2
"Was recommended to Dr Patel by my family Dr. I have GERD and have moved a lot so I have seen my fair share of gastrologists. Dr Patel has an excellent bedside manner and his staff is very accommodating and friendly.

What I like most about Dr Patel is he speaks to the data and doesnt throw his opinion out there in blind speculation . 

I have seen other Drs of gastrology in the trinity FL area and Dr Patel does not treat you like a fast food restaurant , hurrys you out to..."	2
Great!	2
Dr. Patel is very kind and takes his time explaining matters to you. I trust him 100% .	2
Dr. Patel clearly and accurately diagnosed my issue based on the symptoms I shared at my first visit. He is easy to work with and I would definitely recommend him as a GI.	2
Dr Patel is very through and explains things on laymen's terms; yet caring and personable!!	2
Very good experience with this doctor.  He explains things to me so I can explain whats going on.  The staff is incredible.	2
"exceptional
"	2
fine	2
good	2
Dr.Patel is a very kind and caring doctor... so glad i found him!	2
Comfortable 	2
Dr. Patel was very attentive and friendly, however he did not completely go over my colonoscopy report. He left a few things out that my GP went over with me and is now treating me for colitis, which Dr. Patel stated that it was probably not colitis. I feel that he didn't get an overall history from me and with that, could have had a clearer picture of my problems. He read the reports and pretty much based his diagnosis on the reports, not my symptoms or issues.	0
Very good experience, impressed that Doctor Patel actually called me at home! Amazing! I highly recommend Dr. Patel.	2
Simply Experience	1
Couldnt believe how easy the process was. Great Doctor	2
Dr Patel will answer any question.  If he doesn't know the answer he will find the answer.  I feel very comfortable with him. 	2
He is very clear in the diagnosis and treatment. Answers any and all questions. 	2
Office is very pleasant 	2
Tried to see twice. Both times wait was over 2 hrs. Unacceptable. Left without seeing.	0

Profesional and well educated smart provider.	2
Great!!!	2
Never happen,to many patients,I feel Frustrated,This is ridiculous;to many people for 1  Dr.Sorry I'm so sorry.	0
I waited in the office on my first visit for over an hour. Made an appointment for a procedure and wasn't even called that the procedure was cancelled. As a school employee, was off and having the procedure at the end of that business week, and the office manager Marta tells me that they were going to call me and cancel the appointment because he had to take another doctor's patients. Huh? Since when does that happen...Oh since he only had 2 patients for a procedure and would see 10 patients and get more money....ahhh that explains it. Then I rebook for another date and he cancels again. When I called to speak to Marta, it felt like she didnt want to speak to me as I waited for over 10 minutes. She actually pawned me off to another person in the office , after she stated that she would take care of me initially. I would nnever recommend this doctor or any other doctor or service this office provides. if I can give him a zero star I would.	0
I can’t rave enough about Dr. Leon.  He is an expert in his field.  He takes the time to explain treatment for my issues (acid reflux/EOE).  I have annual visits with him to track my progress.  His staff is extremely professional and are very accommodating when it comes to scheduling my appointments.  You will not find a more compassionate and knowledgeable Gastroenterologist in southern Florida. I’ve read some reviews stating his office is always busy and sometimes patients have to wait a little bit to see him…that’s because he’s that good!   Well worth the wait!!  Highly recommend if you want quality care!!	2
Excellent doctor and staff 	2
I feel bad for doctors who are sick and still have to come into work and put on a smile but that's the one thing Dr Leon is really good about although he wasn't feeling good last week he still had a smile on his face and still treated us with respect and you have to admire that in a physician	2
Great office	2
I recently went to see Dr. Leon as a new patient and although it was a little rushed the staff made me feel like family. Dr. Leon medical assistant Byron is awesome he is so attentive and comforting. Plus funny!	2
There is so much I can say about this Doctor, he is one of the smartest doctors I have ever worked with. I have to give a shout out to his MA Will he was in constant communications with me about any delays.	2
Dr Leon restored my faith in doctors today .  He is a doctor who cares about his patients, looks at them when they speak and listens to what they have to say.	2
dr. Leon was very caring and listen to my problems	2
Long story short. Don't even bother to go with him. He CLEARLY doesn't care for his patients. My husband had an appointment with him and after waiting for an HOUR he didn't even show up! The NP walked in. The appointment was with Dr Carlos Leon, NOT anyone else! Completely DISRESPECTFUL!!! They waste people's time. They are clearly unorganized and don't care for the patients at all!!!! No wonder they have horrible reviews everywhere!	0
Office staff and doctor are amazing.	2
Finishing my review about Vivian. It is now 7:30 Thursday June 28th. I still haven’t heard back. That is 3 phone call and two full work days. Unexceptable Ask for the dr. Only when booking an appointment with dr. Leon	0
Unbelievable.....made an appointment, showed up early, no appointment. Nothing but attitude from staff. Worst experience ever in medicine. I'm bleeding internally, could die. They sent me packing. seriously unbelievable. The worst.	0
Dr. Leon is a great doctor who cares for all of his patients. He connects with the patients and makes them feel comfortable from the moment they come in till they leave. 	2
Arrived at 11:16 for an 11;30 appointment.  Didn't see Dr. Leon as there were too many patients.  Saw Vivian at 12;50 and finally got out at 1;22.  Scheduling needs some serious adjustment.  It would seem that all the information that needs to be entered in the computer would be scanned into computer before the patient arrives so that the doctor would be freed up during patient consultation.	0
Arrived for a 1:30 appointment. Wasn't seen until 2:50. Dr. Leon was courteous and helpful, but that is a very, very long wait. The staff in the back office was very kind, but the woman I spoke with on the phone to make the appointment was incredibly rude and put me on hold for 20 minutes. It all seemed very chaotic.	0
"I've only seen Dr. Leon once and he seems to be very knowledgeable and caring. As I was checking out, the last thing he said to me was, ""We're going to figure this out"" and so I will definitely be keep in him on my team! 

He is what I've been looking for in a Dr.; someone who REALLY knows their stuff and determined to find out what's REALLY wrong with me.

The young lady at the front added the cherry on the top. She was very pleasant and professional."	2
Wonderful doctor and staffs.  But, the office is always very busy and therefore, you do not get seen on-time.  If you do not mind the wait, I highly recommend Dr. Leon.	2
Great doctor 	2
Personable and caring.  Thoroughly professional and willing to explain your condition and your treatment. Great guy.	2
Dr. Russo and his staff are excellent.	2
"Russo has performed my colonoscopies for years, but it wasn't until I had a significant digestive issue that I found out he is rude, inattentive and condescending. He's so sure he knows everything that he won't even consider the symptoms you're experiencing with your very own body.

Also, he's very quick to refer patients for gastric bypass procedures which he obviously won't submit to himself. After giving him several opportunities to address my gastro-issues I'm done."	2
"Dr. Russo and his entire staff are excellent. I could not ask for better treatment. I was really worried about being put to sleep because of an extreme sensitivity to drugs, but was assured by the anesthesiologist that he would not leave my side until I was awake. The nurses both in prep, the actual procedure and recovery were all very attentive. Would highly recommend Dr. Russo.
"	2
Great experience. 	2
I found in the first appointment he was very attentive and eager to help. Following visits once my case became out of the normal treatments, he blamed other doctors and diagnoses for my gastric issues. Finally, I had an endoscopy procedure done and he open admitted that the other diagnoses were correct and suggested acupuncture to treat my gastroparesis. He referred me to another GI and stated it was not medically urgent for me to be seen. After me constantly vomiting.	0
Very satisfied with my experience . Dr. Russo was easy to talk to. I would highly recommend him and the rest of his staff. I was in and out in 2 hours..	2
Dr. Russo and his team at the endoscopy center at Ochsner-Baton Rouge were fantastic.  Everything was on time, I was quite comfortable throughout, and I received very clear explanations and timely results.  I would highly recommend Dr. Russo!	2
"Thank you Dr. Aldo Russo and your team of professionals for making me feel at easy during a very scary procedure! You are the best!
"	2
succinct diagnosis and plan of action	1
I had a difficult time cleaning my colon, which required additional treatment. Dr. Russo was great, I will recommend him to my friends. 	2
Dr Russo was very kind and gentle with me while i had my procedure I highly recommend him..Thank Dr Russo	2
I've been with him several years and he takes time to answer any questions and explains things to me. He is polite and courteous, I would recommend him and his staff to anyone.	2
"I was very relaxed & comfortable during my entire colonoscopy procedure -
Thank you Dr. Russo & your team members!


"	2
Outstanding Doctor	2
Dr. Russo was very friendly and professional.  He made my visit more pleasant.	2
The friendly professionalism of Dr. Russo and his staff removes all the possible anxiety that occurs when you know you are going to be put to sleep and undergo a medical procedure..  It is a pleasure to speak to all the friendly folks that take care of you and see to it that you are comfortable before and after the procedure.	2
"Dr Russo was excellent!!!!!
His staff was excellent!!!!
I would recommend this team to everybody!!!!!"	2
I love Dr. Russo and all of the endo staff at Ochsner!  I would never go anywhere else for my care!  	2
"Great guy! Personable and caring. I would recommend him highly to others.
"	2
Dr. Russo and his staff were informative, friendly and caring.	2
My experience with Dr. Russo and his staff was excellent and I would highly recommend him as a physician to everyone. He was very thorough and took his time explaining everything to myself and my husband about my procedures both before and after. I felt very comfortable with him as a doctor and with his knowledge but especially the way he showed himself to be very caring and concerned about his patient. 	2
Dr. Russo is very friendly and comes in to see you both before and after your colonoscopy procedure.  Once I was taken to the prep room until I was released, the entire staff was personable and reassuring.  The Nurse/Anesthetist, Scott, exceeded my expectations in making me feel comfortable and easing any nervousness I was feeling.  My previous colonoscopies had been done elsewhere but, from now on, I will go to Dr. Russo when my time comes up again and would not hesitate to refer anyone to him.	2
"Dr Russo & his staff were all great. I would highly recommended him.
"	2

Very personable, easy to talk to	2
Dr. Russo was so kind and caring.  After meeting him, I was not afraid of the procedure.  I would recommend him to any of my friends.  	2
wonderful doctor...way more than any 5 stars	2
Dr. Russo is every thing and more that a patient could ask for. I do not hesitate to recommend him very  highly to others.	2
Yes . I would  recommend Dr Russo to my friends and family . He was highly professional, thorough , and answered all of my questions.	2

Great interaction.  Takes the time to listen to patient's concerns and respond with medical information that informs and resolves the issues.  	2
I thank him for the reassurance and confidence he gave me in approaching and having the endoscopy and colonoscopy.  The experience was certainly as pleasant as these can be.  I trust his evaluation of my individual findings.      Thanks to Dr. Russo and all assisting Staff.	2
He is thoughtful and detailed with answers to questions and easy to talk to.	2
My family uses Dr Russo and feels very comfortable  with his skills as well as his ability  to show he is concerned about you as a patient and person. Very easy to talk to and extremely though.  I would recommend  Dr Russo for your health care needs. 	2
I make sure I go and get a colonoscopy every time my insurance will allow, and once I paid for it myself. Why? Because every male in my family has died from Colon Cancer at an early age. Dr. Russo recognizes this and each visit with him, either in the office or for a procedure, he is thorough,  understanding and reassuring. His bedside manner always puts me at ease and even if has been 3 years between visits, he walks in with a smile and remembers details about my life. 	2
Excellent, very professional and knowledgeable.	2
This was my first visit with Dr. Russo. He really took the time to listen to me and my concerns. He looked over the information and test results that I brought with me from former doctors. He gave me confidence that he will work with me to try to find resolutions to my problems unlike some other doctors in other places	2
Dr. Russo was very friendly and explained the procedure and risk associated with it very clearly to me.  And I sincerly appreciate his staff and that my procedure was done on time, in fact a little earlier than I had been told.	2
In my experiences with Dr. Russo, he's a friendly and caring physician.  I will highly recommend him.	2
It was my 1st time going to Dr Russo. Great bedside manner!He was very nice & friendly when he walked in,listened to my concerns and was very attentive. He also was very professional during the exam and explained what he was doing.Dr Russo even told me he would email instructions prior to surgery and other info &I requested a printout too.Rec'd an email& printout as Dr Russo promised.After my visit, the nurse and Dr Russo responded to my emails in a timely manner-as a patient that means a lot!! 	2
Efficient, friendly, informative.  All in all, outstanding.	2
Dr. Russo took the time to listen to all of my questions, to offer full explanations and to make sure that I fully understood the information. Very professional and knowledgeable.	2
Great !!!!!!!	2
He was very considerate and took my concerns seriously. 	2
I had the doctor preform a colonoscopy and endoscopy.  She found possible problems and prescribed medications.  She has an easy personality.	2
Dr. Tsuchida is a very attentive and superb doctor.	2
Dr. T has a very compassionate and kind approach. She is very easy to talk to and tell her my symptoms. At this time she accepts Medicaid and it can be difficult to find a specialist who will take Medicaid.	0
No follow through!! My problem was never diagnosed and i was left with no mention of follow up care. Tests & procedures were performed to rule out items yet I am no closer to finding answers than I was prior to seeing Dr.Trope. I am baffled by the lack of follow through by such a well reviewed physician.	0
"Great experience being at his office, and later going through the procedure.
He and his staff are knowledgeable and respectful, and make me felt very comfortable  
I strongly recommend Dr Trope"	2
Very knowledgeable doctor who obviously cares for his patients.  I was put at ease by his very direct yet personable mannerisms.  Looking forward to receiving further care from this provider.	2
Dr Trope is a very caring professional. I’m very confident in him and the care he gives me. I would highly recommend him.	2

He was great explaining what my problem was.	2
"Dr. Trope is very good in his explanation of your condition and counsels you on how to improve your health.
Bottom line is he cares."	2
Dr. Trope is an excellent gastroenterologist and has been treating me over 10 years. My visits are very comprehensive and he takes the time to explain to me what may be causing my symptoms as well as treatment plan. I think he and his staff are professional and always willing to help with my personal medical diagnosis. We need more physicians like him!	2
Dr. Trope was very personable, kind & caring....he took his time with me, answered all my questions, and I did not feel rushed	2

He and his staff are  so knowledgeable, kind and professional. He is an excellent doctor.	2
Great doctor. Very thorough with explanations and proceduresj.’	2
One of the most positive Dr. visits I've had in recent times in Florida.  Cheerful office staff, clean facility, and a doctor that actually patiently listened to my issues. My first impression is Dr. Trope seems to be genuinely concerned and will do his best to help find and correct my problem.	2
The doctor really listened to my concerns and was very knowledgeable and I was very much impressed. He was very proactive with a treatment plan and I was able to schedule a colonoscopy within a week. Very tremendous service and I highly recommend him. 	2
My first visit with Dr. trope went very well.  He listened and took his time with me.  I feel good recommending him to anyone who needs a gastroenterologist.	2

A very caring and thorough doctor. Took time to discuss any questions that I might have had.   His follow up is amazing. I’m so happy to have a doctor that I thoroughly trust. Would definitely recommend dr. Trope	2
"Dr. Trope is easy to talk to and listens to my concerns. He is very knowledgeable and seems to advocate natural products which can easily be found in your drug store where applicable vs. jumping to an Rx. I was impressed with that.

I found Dr. Tope’s office staff to be very efficient, friendly and concerned as well as being very well versed in their individual duties and they run on time. No sitting and waiting forever. 

I highly recommend this Dr. and feel fortunate to have found him."	2
Dr. Trope is a wonderful physician. He listens to what you have to say, he’s very compassionate. I would recommend him to all my friends.	2

Dr trope is so thorough, efficient, and also takes the time to explain your issues and discuss the recommended plan of action.  I’ve seen him now for several years and he’s consistently one of the best physicians I know. 	2
"Dr. Trope’s expertise is only exceeded by his kindness and willingness to listen to his patients.  He and his staff treat everyone with respect and you never feel that medicine is just a business, but rather that he honors his profession by actually trying to help his patients heal their illnesses and symptoms.

Wow!  Compassionate and caring!  He listened with so much concern & prescribed a plan I was comfortable with......HIGHLY RECOMMEND	2
Dr. Trope is one of the best doctors that I have ever had to go to. I myself was in the medical field for many years, and it is rare to find such a genuine, caring and knowledgeable doctor. This is one of only 2 reviews that I have ever thought about giving 5 stars. His staff are also some of the best, but it is easy to see why	2
Excellent very easy talk to explains procedures clearly and why he is recommending them.  I’m very confident with him 	2
Couldn’t ask for a better doctor.	2

"I would just like to say to anyone who needs the services in his field Dr trope is truly an amazing physician.
My experience with him has been as near to a miracle as I can explain.
He is an extremely knowledgeable Healthcare professional and his bedside manner can definitely put you at ease."	2
I have seen Dr Trope for 3 years now. He did my colonoscopy and endoscopy. He took me off a medication that wasn’t very safe and put me on one that is for my acid reflux. At this last appointment he actually wanted me to try to decrease my dose so he is not all about giving medicine just because. He would rather you not be on any if possible. He asks questions and he listens. I would definitely recommend him. He has a great accent too being from Africa. ??	2
Takes all the time need for a good exam.  Answers all of my questions.  Not rushed.  	2
Dr. Trope was very personable, took the time to explain the procedures, and in general made me feel comfortable.  Normally I am very uncomfortable in a doctor’s office.	2
 Dr Rajca, excellent, exceptional, knowledgeable, are few words to qualify his professionalism. Dr Rajca is the best. 	2

And unlike many doctors he has been very prompt and on time for my appointment. I strongly recommend Dr. Rajca. 	2
Very friendly and made me very comfortable	2
Service was excellent 	2
Very personable with a great “bedside”manner. Seems to run pretty much on schedule and in my case made a referral to another specialist for nearly immediate treatment ( 2 business days). He is a “get er done” Doctor that you can have confident professional help. 	2
Listened to my issues I am having . Very proactive and has laid out several options for me . 	2
Dr. Rajca was an amazing physician and really made me feel comfortable and secure that he was so knowledgeable. His staff handled every detail as well. My procedure was a breeze and he very thoroughly discussed my treatment plan which has been successful after many years previously of no answers. Would highly recommend him!	2
I feel I was misdiagnosed by Dr Radjca. I had abdominal acistis (water in stomach membrane) and was told to take Benefiber and it would go away.  My condition did not get better until I was on Amoxicillim for an ear infection.  The 8th day of treatment the acites started to drain.  I now feel I was misdiagnosed and actually have a very bad stomach bacteria called H-Pyloria, causes  cancer which would be diagnosed by blood test or UREA breath test. None was done!! I was sen home with Omazeprole 	0
Dr Rajca spent the time I needed to fully understand what I needed.  He was very personable and easy to relate to.  I would recommend him to everyone!	2
Very professional, great bedside manners. Glad I found this Dr	2
Dr. Rajca is very personable, has a great bedside manner. He answered all my questions. Thanks for taking good care of me! Tracy	2
Very accommodating. Got me in for a last minute appointment. Took time to listen.	1
Dr. Brian Rajca is a first rate doctor with a first rate bedside manner.  He is very thorough and spends time analying before diagnosing, then demonstrates urgency in implementing a treatment action plan.  DBR is awesome and he’s my kind of doctor, and I recommend him highly.	2
First time visit always makes me a little nervous. I have diverticulitis and needed a gastroenterologist to evaluate. The office was brand new, with a comfortable and clean lobby. The staff out front couldn't have been nicer. I didn't have to wait very long even though I was early. The nurses were very kind and helpful. The doctor was welcoming and easy going. He took his time and was very knowledgeable and reassuring about my condition, and gave me a lot of useful information. I am very happy.	2
A pleasure to talk too. Takes the time to answer questions and address your concerns. I was very nervous about my appointment but the way I was treated made me relax.	2
Dr Rajca was wonderful ! He was caring and compassionate and listened to your concerns. 	2
Great	2

Excellent Dr.	2
Today is my first visit at Dr. Katz’s office. The Dr. and his staff have been more than I expected I am very pleased. Special thanks to Danny and Mari!	2
Amazing and most down to earth doctor.  Because of his concern of me being over weight and being so honest about it. I decided to do something about my weight. Presently I am down 15lbs and eager to continue my journey of getting healthy Thank god for Dr. Katz and his honesty. 	2
Compassionate	2
Dr. Katz is one of the best doctors I have dealt with in my lifetime. So the reason I'm saying this is because he has a great bedside manner, he seems to get to the questions that he knows you're going to forget to ask.  So when you leave him you feel like you know what's going on. very important. The staff also need to make mention of the staff who also make you feel when you leave you know what's going on.	2
“Felt that I got the best possible treatment and owe my life to the Doctor and Staff! I might not be alive if Doctor didn’t listen and insist I go to the Hospital and follow his diagnosis and recommended treatment! Very caring and concerned!” Thank you Dr Katz.	2
He had a God complex what's an open to hearing any suggestions he said because I am a high-risk patient I will not be doing any procedures on you even though I told him that I had a procedure at JFK because I am high risk 	1
This doctor is so awesome I recommend him to anyone who is looking for a clear answer.	2
The other day the JFK system was down and although it could of been a nightmare the staff was very professional and constantly communicating any updates. I was so pleased and surprised, they even went around offering water and snacks! 	2
I had an appointment with Dr. Katz today, he is such a great doctor. He listens and replies in a way I can understand that's very important for people who do not understand medical terms	2
The visit was very enjoyable Dr. Katz  answer all my questions, with a big smile made me feel like I was very important. Dr. Katz staff is very helpful 	2
A wonderful physician.  Very caring.  Sits with you and explains everything.  You don't feel rushed. Office staff is very friendly	2
"I feel so fortunate to have found Dr. Katz. After 
my doctor of 10 yrs. retired I tried several other doctors and none measured up to the high standard of care I was accustomed to. Then I met Dr. Katz. If you are looking for  high quality medical care this is the right doctor. I'm  receiving in depth tests no other doctor thought to order to discover the source of my problem. I feel safe again finally finding a caring doctor. A patient/doctor/trust relationship is everything! 
       "	2
Dr. Katz provided outstanding care for my 89 year old father.  In an emergency situation, his diagnosis was completely accurate and his treatment was very effective.  He was very accessible and always very helpful. 	2
Dr. Katz is a true professional.  I trust him and his knowledge beyond any other GI Dr. I have encountered.  He is friendly, outgoing, and very concerned.  The office is a little busy, and sometimes communications is lacking but Dr. Katz is well worth these little inconveniences.	2
"Best doctor in Palm Beach
If you need a gastroenterologist...
See him ! "	2
"Dr. Aviv Katz is very caring, and I feel really comfortable with him as my digestive disease physician.
.Last year had a colonoscopy which he performed. I realize this is a very private procedure and am sharing because it is a very important exam. I had lost a colleague friend to colon cancer who was only in her 50's and unfortunately by the time she had her exam, she was in the fourth stage of colon cancer. So if you are thinking of having this exam, I would recommend Dr Aviv Katz. "	2
"I first chose Dr. Katz because he is a provider with my insurance.
I am highly recommending Dr. Katz for his excellent medical care and diagnostic services.  His office staff is efficient and highly effective in scheduling and managing appointments, tests, and follow ups.  They also make the time to courteously and professionally answer questions during phone calls.  "	2
I have been under the care of Dr Katz for about 6 years.. I have full confidence in all his medical advise,,,,  He is patient and answers all questions. I would never consider seeing anyone else. 	2
A lovely calm and personable doc who actually listens and discusses ! First Gastro I can relate to and trust!	2
Dr. Katz and his team were fabulous in taking care of my father when he was 1st diagnosed with GI issues. My father was in ICU and having multiple issues going on at once, and Dr. Katz and his team stayed in contact with one another and made sure they kept the family informed. This team and Dr. Katz did   Phenomenal Job and I'm happy to say that  my father is on the road to recovery because of the care and time they took. 	2
I just left the Dr. Katz office this morning feeling hopeful and at peace. He greeted me with a warm and pleasant smile. He took the time to properly explain my options to resolve my digestive issue. Extremely knowledgable, and he actually cares. Great Doctor!	2
Horrible!  I was admitted to hospital 12/4 and less than 12 hrs. after being admitted he came in while I was alone and very coldly told me I had 3 to 6 months to live and that I should sign a DNR and put myself in hospice, they'd keep me comfy until I died.  I was 45 yrs. old with children and a new grandbaby.  If I had listened to him I wouldn't be here today.  I laid there 3 wks and didn't get well. Checked out AMA, got another Dr. and 9 months later I'm doing FANTASTIC because of my NEW Dr.	0
He saw me as an emergency and he was very professional and knowledgeable.	2
Dr Katz is great.  He took care of my father at JFK.  He updated me through daily phone calls while  I was in New York.  He made me feel at ease knowing my father had a doctor who took interest in him.  	2
He has a level of arrogance that made me feel uncomfortable asking any questions. He made a lot of assumptions that were not correct.. This was all when I was hospitalized. I would never follow up with his Office practice.	0
Horrible experience. Was told to come in 15 minutes early to do paperwork as I was a new patient.  I arrived 15 minutes prior to my scheduled appt., did the paperwork, and then sat in the office for 1 hour and 40 min. before being seen by Dr. Katz.  After I inquired twice (after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting), he saw me and was very quick and rushed while I was trying to ask him questions concerning my health.  Did not express much interest in me or my health concerns.  	0
Dr. Katz is an amazing Doctor. He answers all my questions and seems to actually care. I'm very happy with my service. 	2
Excellent	2
Honest.  Very direct with me.   He was the first doctor to get me to stop drinking.  I've been to tons of other doctors who were afraid to tell me the truth.  Without his direct honesty I wouldn't have ever been able to stop drinking and get a liver transplant.  	2
Was told to come in 15 minutes early to do paperwork, sat in office 2 hours before I saw the doctor. When I did see him for 5 minutes his advice was I would be healthier if I quit smoking and lost weight. Told me try weight watchers. For this sage advice he charged $235. The whole time he was condescending and judgmental. I cancelled any future appointments and will never see him again.	0
DR.Katz practice is very busy, it takes several weeks to secure  an appointment (contrary to his video below) then when you do arrive it's standing room only.  I waited 45 days to book my appointment and then waited another 2 hrs beyond my scheduled appointment. My time and day was wasted. Clearly quantity over quality is being practiced here. Get in line and take a #. 	0
Dr Shepard is wonderful , very professional and caring	2
Exceptional!  Cleared my reoccurring CDiff 3 years ago!  Doctors in Boston had given up!  Thank you Doc Shepperd & staff!!!!	2
I’ve been seeing Dr. Shepard for a year now. The progression of my disease seems to have stalled. I know that this dramatic turn is due to Dr. Shepard’s very unique protocol and prescriptions. I have never felt this healthy for such a long span of time. While my other doctors are scratching their heads, Dr. Shepard is continuing to blaze courageous new trails in treatments and care. There are simply not enough ways to say “Thank you” to Dr. Shepard and his staff. 	2
I was blessed to have been highly referred to Dr. Shepard.  Dr. Shepard is warm and personable, exceptionally competent with an ability to grasp complex situations, and an excellent practitioner.  His staff is calm and treats patients respectfully.  Dr. Shepard has no ego, and communicates on and “adult to adult” basis, and not the usual “adult to child” dynamics of so many ego driven doctors.  I drive from St. Pete Beach, and probably drive past 100 gastros on the way over: Shepard is excellent	2
"First of all, Dr. Shepard's team at his office in Tampa ROCK!  They care, they get you in as quickly as they can (even though this Doctor has an excellent reputation and is very  busy).  I have waited about 5 minutes at the most from the time I sign in at the front desk to getting moved back for vitals and seeing Dr. Shepard.

He is top notch with his demeanor, the amount of time spent with you as a patient who needs to learn more about their gut and how to improve our health.

Overall fantastic"	2
Was of the nicest, most helpful physicians that I've found in the Tampa area in my 45 years here.  Answered all of my questions, reassured me through any nervousness, and thoroughly covered future plans of care.  I recommend him to everyone!!	2
"Dr. Shepard was the first doctor to A.) Really listen, and B.) tell me he knew what was wrong with me and knew how to fix it.
He saved my life. I can now eat salads and fruits that I haven’t eaten in four years!!!"	2
"Dr. Shepard is a very ‘Trustworthy’ Doctor.
I had severe chest pains for 2 months while internal medicine Dr. , Cardio Dr. Specialist ran echocardiogram,   CT scan etc.   a process of elimination search.
Next Dr.Shepherd did an Endoscopy which revealed inflamed esophagus and stomach from GERD acids...Acid Reflux ‘mimics’ a heart attack and during the meantime I was suffering immensely.   He immediately placed me on the Rx  Cralfate and pain diminished in a week!   A thoroughly competent Doctor!"	2
I would recommend Dr Shepard in a heartbeat! I've been coming to him for over 10 yrs now and trust him completely. He is very knowledgeable, understanding, patient, respectful, and listens to your concerns. I feel he tries to get to the root of the issue rather than just treating the symptoms. 	2
Dr Shepard was very good.   I had absolutely no problems with my procedure or recovery!  	2
I had a FMT in December of 2016 That I believe Saved my life.I was very sick from Cdiff  related to antibiotics that were givin to me in the hospital in August of 2016 .I can eat  a lot of things now when before I could eat absolutely nothing. My condition was extremely bad so I'm still not 100% but I know with Dr Shepard's help I will be soon. I thank God for Dr Shepard and his staff.	2
I have Crohn's, and I have moved around and had many GI doctors. Dr. Shepard is the best. I'm not the easiest patient, but he will take as much time as necessary to listen to my many questions and devise a plan.  He is also active and up to date with research and diet protocols (sadly this has been a big problem with past doctors).   He listens and discusses what makes me feel better and doesn't just tell me what I have to do.  His staff are also very knowledgeable.     	2
My mother is 87. She has had episodes of GI bleeds and abdominal pain. He is very kind and patient with her.  He did the endoscopes and colonoscopies, and she did very well.	2
Very friendly staff and helpful.  Dr Shepard was non alarming and very easy to talk to.	2
Staff VERY confrontational!   I had appt scheduled at 2pm... Front desk woman claimed it was 1:30... and didn't know if she could even get me in at that point!  	0
It is a sweet and caring doctor. He really listens and cares for his patients. 	2
I have been going to Dr Verma for many years.  He is always upbeat, compassionate and caring.  He takes the time to explain what is going on with my health as well as any options that might be available.  His attitude is outstanding.  I will continue to see him as well as recommend him to others.  Thank you!	2
My husband and I see Dr Verma and we can't say enough good things about him! He is a kind, considerate and compassionate man. He always takes the time to explain things and also works me in when needed.	2
Dr. Verma has provided care for me and my family for many years.  We have always received excellent care.  He is very kind and considerate and takes time to answer all questions.  His staff is very friendly and cares about all needs.  I recommend him very highly.	2
"I am 81 years old. Dr. Verma has provided service to me and family members for many years. Obviously his diagnosis, preventative proceedures, and treatment have been excellent. I do have digestive system issues.
In addition to the above I greatly appreciate his communication with me. He does an excellent job of discussing the diagnosis, recommendations, and results. His office and staff is very accessible. 
Dr. Verma is a down to earth, friendly ,cheerful, and an easy to talk to Doctor - has a good sense of humor.
By the way, his practice is in a very nice new modern state of the art facility."	2
Dr Verma is excellent gastroenterology specialist. He is very kind and considerate.  My wife and I have been going to him for years. We recommend him highly.  His staff was excellent. Great people.	2
He is a competent, patient and compassionate physician. Care has been excellent	2
Dr Verma Ansil  is one of my favorite Doctors. He has a wonderful manner, explains everything to you, take the time to answer all your questions and is very easy to talk to. He make sure you are comfortable when he does any procedure and that you understand what he will be doing. He is one doctor I fell cares about my welfare as his patient. He also has a wonderful staff who are very easy to deal with. I highly recommend Dr Verma Ansil!!!!!!!!	2
My wife was a nurse she resurrect a doctor who was very good that she trusted. He has been a good one. If she was here today she would be happy with the results 	2
I was referred to Dr. Verma.. While I agree with his thoroughness as others have stated, I feel he failed to listen to me as a patient. I explained in great detail the specific symptoms I was experiancing and when and how often.. Still yet to know what's wrong after my Ultrasound, CT Scan, HIDA Scan &  Scope.. He just wants to order more expensive tests.. Does he care to treat what he sees without more tests?? I want a new Dr. ??	0
Responsive and kind.  Extremely  pleasant and patient.	2
Dr. Verma is an outstanding board-certified physician who takes the time to listen to his patients to assess the medical issue at hand. He is sensitive to a patient’s needs and has an excellent bedside manner. His staff is courteous and professional and they go out of their way to accommodate  your requests.  I have been a patient for a little bit over four years and I’m thankful I was referred to him.	2
Excellent visit.  Took the time to explore all facets of my problems.  Direct analysis.  Staff extremely cordial.  Highly recommended and always follows up.	2
"Seemed very friendly & interested in figuring out my digestion issues. After surgery was unsuccessful, and  additional inconclusive tests I was told that I would just have to learn to live with my inability to eat without getting sick. I am able to keep from losing weight now, though I'm 15-20 lbs lighter than when I started, so I don't think this will kill me, but not ""normal"". Staff was VERY rude to my wife when she called to ask if we would receive info after the last test. (UNPROFESSIONAL!!)"	0
Dr. Verma is a great doctor. He is very thorough and listens to his patients. My Mom is a patient but his MA Glenda is extremely arugmentative and very condescending to my mother and myself when I talk inquiry about her care. I also witness her being nasty to another patient while I was in the office with my Mom. While Dr. Verma is a great physician, the hostility we have to deal with the staff makes it not worth it. Looking for another GI for my mom. 	2
After suffering from severe silent reflux disease for a year, I have had to go to Dayton Gastro for help because Digestive Specialists did not make me better. At the start of 2017 I needed a new prescription for my PPI medicine which Digestive Specialists took 6 weeks to refill. My time and money have been wasted because he performed an endoscopy on me, but did not even insert a PH probe. So I have to have another endoscopy to insert a PH probe. Going to Digestive specialists was a mistake.	0
Finally I found a professional Dr that cares about my health. I visited th Beavercreek office and was very impressed with Dr Verma and his complete staff. The office was clean, the atmosphere was inviting, the staff was caring, and Dr Verma walked into the patient room in a suit and tie and a great big smile, which really put me at ease.  I was very sick at the time, but I couldn't help but notice his  medical professionalism. I highly recommend Dr Verma to anyone looking for a #1 Doctor. 	2
"Dr. Verma looks not only at my digestive problems but considers my whole body health.  He   does blood work often which has revealed other health problems and has referred to specialist in other areasg  An example of this is when he referred me to Dr. Jain because of ongoing problems with me hemoglobin.  My ulcerated colitis in in good control as is  the problems I has having with  reflux.  Dr. Verma is a fine doctor and I feel fortunate of be a patient of his.
"	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Verma's for over 10 years and I absolutely recommend him to anyone in need of a gastroenterologist.  His depth of knowledge is matched only by his concern to see his patients live the highest quality of life possible through managed care. My wife is a Family Medicine physician and has referred many patients to Dr. Verma.  You can not get much better than a doctor who is trusted by others doctors to take care of their own families. 	2
"Dr. Verma has been caring for my husband's Crohn's for years. Beyond being a excellent and knowledgeableble physician, he shows compassion and the utmost kindness to us.
I have felt comfortable recommending family, friends and patients to his care.
"	2
Dr. Verma is one of the best doctors I have utilized.  I have recommended him to numerous friends.  He is available for both office visits and procedures on weekends and is dedicated to his patients.  	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Verma's for over a decade and have always been extremely pleased with the level of care received.  He always takes the time to listen to what I have to say and keeps up with the latest developments in Gastroenterology.  His staff is outstanding (especially at the Brubaker office) and I always feel special, even though a great many patients are being attended.  Highly recommend.	2
He is very thorough and easy to talk to.	2
Having been a patient for 10 years with Dr. Verma, I would highly recommend him to ANYONE who would want excellent care. He is kind, patient, caring with an great sense of humor with bedside manner.  He thoroughly reviews your case and explains in detail your diagnosis and treatment.  	2
"I have been going to Dr. Verma for over ten years.  Dr. Verma without a doubt is a very caring and listens carefully to your concerns and treats you accordingly.  I would trust him with my life. He is easy to talk with, a very good listener, and will do whatever is necessary to take care of you.  He is a true professional and anyone should be proud to have him as your doctor.

I have observed on many occasions the staff that works around him..  They have nothing but positives to say about him."	2
Suffering from severe ulcerative colitis but had to wait over 1 month from colonoscopy to have follow up appointment, receive my results, and get proper medications.  The office staff argued with me on the phone explaining to me how my concerns were not valid and the doctor was going out of his way to help me.  This was not true.  I have dealt with various specialists in the past and have not had an experience like this.  My wife is a nurse and was appalled at the way I was treated.	0
Takes the time to listen to your problems and is very knowledgeable. A very good demeanor as well. 	2
Dr. Chawla is a stellar example of a physician that cares. I took my mom to see Dr. Chawla for a colonoscopy consult. He took the time to put my mother at ease, reviewed her history, offered recommendations and instilled a lot of confidence. He made eye contact and conveyed his feedback in simple terms. He has the old world charm of connecting with patients, listening to them and making it personal. Its a lost art and it is so refreshing to see it these days! Dr. Chawla is also very astute, talented and methodical. I would definitely recommend Dr. Chawla to all friends and family.	2
I went to Dr. Chawla for my first colonoscopy and would strongly recommend him. He put me at ease, explained the process and just did a great job.	2
Dr Chawla is a caring, compassionate, jovial and highly-skilled physician.  You will immediately feel at ease with him.   Foremost, he cares about you as a person, not just another patient.   Dr Chawla is a shining star in the medical profession and I appreciate that I was able to receive his care.    I would enthusiastically recommend him to any prospective patients including my loved ones.	2
Dr. Chawla is very personable and very thorough.  He really cares about his patients.  I feel very comfortable that I am getting the best care ever. Thank you Dr. Chawla, you are awesome!	2
(I have Crohn's.) I had been avoiding gastroenterologists for the longest time because of bad experiences in the past. When I moved to the area, I finally decided to give another specialist a shot. With Dr. Chawla I found the perfect fit. He knows to listen and treats his patients with respect. Furthermore, he leaves no stone unturned. I/We have finally found something that has helped me. It's an ongoing struggle but with Dr. Chawla I feel optimistic about the future. 	2
"He was able to make me feel at ease and correctly Medicate for my GI issues. He took the time to answer all of my
questions and had incredible bedside manner. I am so happy I found him. "	2
"Dr. Chawla is a great doctor, I would say he is the best doctor I could have to treat my GI issues.
He has a really good matters and care his patients like they are part of his family.  I felt totally confident with him and his abilities to diagnostic all my situation.  Everything that he prognostic on the first visit happened until the end of the treatment.  
I just would like to say Thank you Dr. Chawla!"	2
He did my colonoscopy 2 years ago. Naturally, I was a little nervous, but he was great and I remember it as a positive experience. Will go to him again. 	2
A terrible doctor. Failed miserably in regards to an accurate diagnosis. Clearly did not listen and was more interested in trying to impress with how much he knew, but he clearly got it wrong. Would never recommend.	0
Intelligent, caring doctor with great social skills.  He was adept at synthesizing my complicated gi medical history and communicating his diagnosis to me in a clear, thoughtful manner.  Wish we had more doctors like him in the region.  Top notch doctor in all respects.	2
I was concerned about some health issues before I got my colonoscopy.  Dr Chawla took the time to go over each issue being sure I understood completely.  He took extra time to explain in detail so I felt comfortable and safe. 	2
Holy cow. Amazing bedside manner. Spent a great deal of time with me, was very knowledgable and empathatic.	2
"Dr. Lal gives you his total attention. He spends quality time with his patients. He is very intelligent and was able to ease my stress over a procedure. 
I would recommend Dr. Lal to everyone.... and I have!"	2
"Dr.Lal is very nice and knows how to treat you with the problem you might
have. I would recommend Dr. Lal Also I would give him a 5-star rating."	2
Dr. Lal is an awesome dr. He is very thorough in explaining all the details of your sickness. He will take care of you. Knowledgeable and kind and thorough	2
Dr Lal is amazing! He takes the time to listen to what is going on, and he will keep searching until he finds the answers.	2
Dr.Lal and staff are the friendliest medical provider in the CSRA. Dr.Lal knows his practice and is excellent at it. I’m thankful to have him attending me and my issues.	2
Dr. Lal and his staff are always welcoming and caring of my needs. I'm always made to feel like a family member. I recommend Dr. Lal to anyone that has a need for a Gastroenterologist.	2
I was in the office on July 18,2019. I arrived on time and was only in the waiting area about fifteen minutes before I was called to the exam room. My visit plus my appointment for the surgical center was all completed within twenty-five minutes and I was out and on my way home. Dr. Lal and staff was all courteous and concern with my condition. Was very pleased with my visit.	2
"Dr. Lal is fine of the most professional, caring and loving health specialist I have ever met.  He always provides time for you to express your concerns and feelings.  Recently when my wife passed away, he came in, hugged me and allowed me time to talk about her death.
He always assures my family and friends that he is there and will take care of me if anything is wrong.
Recently when he referred me to another doctor I will never forget his words as I left his office, ""We are going to take care of you, you can count on that""
Most doctors don't even tell you goodbye.
Dr. Lal deserves our utmost love, respect and support in his chosen profession.
Thanks Dr. Lal for all you have done for me."	2
I had a scheduled colonoscopy with Dr. Lal in early July 2019.  His staff prepared me for this procedure, which I had no idea would be so invasive.  I had the intention of using a ride-share to return home after the procedure.  But, his staff members were very kind and professional in explaining the dangers involved with this.  I was advised to call a family member or a close friend who could pick me up after the procedure and see that I got home safely.  They were very thorough in explaining this, and I greatly appreciated it.	2
Follow up visit	1
Excellent doctor??????	2
Excellant physician, on time, knows your history,  simplifies issues for us. Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.	2
"Dr. Lal  has a way of explaining what your problem is, what has cased it, and what his next steps will be. All is presented in a way that is very confident and reassuring.  

When dealing with Dr. Lal and all of his staff you get the feeling you are the only patient they have, and take all the time needed to address your questions.  

Most important is immediately you know your dealing with a good man and a well ran staff. "	2
I felt everyone cared about me on the day of my procedure.  I was told to expect a call or text in a couple of days to see if I'm doing well.  I am also scheduled for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks.	2
He genuinely acts like he cares in those brief ten minutes a patient gets with him after waiting forever in the waiting /exam rooms. He’s too eager to scope and less apt to listen to his patients about what works for them in the past especially if the patient has a long history with Crohn’s. I was his patient for a year and grew tired of his arrogance. 	2
Dr. Lal has very good bed side manner. He was patient and listened to my concerns and that was very impressive. Looking forward to him resolving my stomach issues. 	2
Dr Lal is amazing!! He knows how you feel because he has been through the same issues as you! I highly recommend Dr Lal!! 	2
Dr Lal was straightforward about my upcoming routine colonoscopy procedure. He stated he will take good care of me. I'm very pleased with our brief conversation. So far,  I'm  very pleased with Dr. Lal and his office staff. If possible, I will update my comments after my procedure next month. 	2
I am so glad that a friend recommended me to Dr. Lal. He had excellent bedside manner and was truly determined to get to the bottom of my ongoing health issues.	2
Awesome	2
So attentive and such a nice man.  Staff is super friendly also.	2
He is an awesome doctor!	2
I have complete confidence In Dr. Lal and his staff regarding my diverticulitis and related health needs. He orders appropriate tests and reports the results, explaining his decisions for my care as he goes along.	2
Dr. Lal is very knowledgeable and takes time to explain test results and options for treatment.  He consults with other physicians in an effort to provide the best possible care to his patients.  Dr. Lal is an excellent doctor and I feel fortunate to have been referred to him for treatment.	2
Dr. Lal is respectable, kind and caring for his patience, he takes the time to explain what’s going on and what kind of test to find out what’s wrong. He does everything he can to do his best to find out what’s wrong and get you to feeling better.	2
Professional staff, Dr. Lal listened, discussed options, provided recommendation to possibly decrease some symptoms in the interim before discussed procedure. Day of procedure checked with me prior to answer any questions.  	1
Awesome physician! Great bedside manner and very caring! Love Dr Lal! 	2
My son began seeing Dr. Lal in March 2018 for liver issues. The ease of getting an appt was important. When I called & explained my son's situation, we were able to see Dr. Lal the next day.  Dr. Lal started on my son's testing right away.  The road to recovery is lengthy in my son's particular situation but I feel we are on the right road and in the very best hands possible. We love Dr. Lal and I am extremely grateful for his caring and genuine nature	2
Dr. Lal is extremely lacking in bedside manner. During my initial consultation, he browsed his smartphone while I asked questions. In my follow-up, he looked at his watch while I asked questions. Perhaps Dr. Lal was signaling that he was short on time as my wait exceeded two hours for both visits. Dr. Lal is also careless as he wrote a prescription for the wrong quantity. I'd strongly suggest finding another gastroenterologist and avoiding Dr. Lal.	0
"Dr. Lal is a true professional compassionate caring doctor. Dr Lal’s demeanor is warm and friendly. He listens closely to understand your medical issues, diagnoses the problem and explains the treatment process.
Wait time is minimal 10 minutes. But Dr Lal spends quality time and will stay with us for as long as we have questions, which he thoroughly explains.
Dr Lal’s staff is excellent, efficient, friendly and caring.
Dr Lal ends the appointment session with a warm and friendly hug.
"	2
Dr. Lal and team are very caring and helpful.  He is attentive and caring.	2
Dr Lal was  very personable and seemed to be interested in the problems I was having. J	2
I found Dr. Lai  knowledgeable, easy to talk to and very competent. Would definitely use him again.	2
Dr. Lal is so patient and kind. He really cares about his patients and their health. Best doctor in the csra!	2
He is really great and understanding. I didn’t even wait long before I was called to the back to be seen. If I could give him 10 stars I would 	2
Dr. Lal takes the time to listen and assess your issues. Great doctor!	2
I will never expose a family or friend to what I experienced under Dr. Lal's care. The incredibly apathetic attitude expressed towards my grievances were completely unacceptable. I have been dealing with a medical issue for 8 years I thought would get resolved by going back to Dr. Lal and his initial findings 6 years ago. To be constantly misdiagnosed and to be treated with such little care that was provided by my appointments is a disgrace to the medical community. SHAME ON YOU!	0
"Beginning a new patient , The staff is very caring and made me feel welcome. 
Any concerns I  had they were there for me . The staff  answer my question  at a timely manner.  I didn't have to wait long to be seen. The doctor was very caring about any concerns I had. You would like the fact that everything is explain to you . So you can understand what is your issue maybe. "	2
Very nice and staff was very nice. Listened to what I had to say. Even though office was busy it did not take long to be seen.	2
Dr. Lal is the best doctor ever. Him and his staff are great and truly care about his patients.	2
Dr. Lal is great, he listens, explains and understands his patients' struggles.  His staff is a struggle to deal with when trying to call the office, getting refills, etc...	2
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. LAL. GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. TO ME THAT IS IMPORTANT.  HE IS ALSO VERY SKILLED IN GI.	2
I find Dr Lal easy to talk to. He explains what’s going on within me in a way I can understand and relate to..  He seems concerned about my problem and my health. I have already referred him to friends and relatives. Thank you for the opportunity to reply. 	2
He's everything you want in a doctor. You'll feel completely at ease and like you're in good hands. 	2
Dr. Lal has been great in treating my digestive issues.  I have no hesitation in recommending him as your Gastroenterologist.	2
Dr Lal listened to all my concerns and then together we worked out a plan to figure out what is wrong. The wait time in his office was very quick but not once did I feel rushed Dr. Lal and his staff deserve  10 stars	2
Dr. Lal is the best of the best!!	2
Dr Lal is like no other Dr. I've ever met! He works with and for you to help you! He had to send me to surgeon and when I came back to him and told him that the other Dr basically said I was fine, Dr. Lal was mad and said that's not good enough, he then called another surgeon right in the room with me and got me in to see him the next morning! I was shocked! I thanked him, he told me, don't thank me yet, wait til I get you better! That's a true Dr, If you want a Dr. on your side, he's the one!	2
 All of the  nurses  and CNA's  were very polite  and kind, I didn't have to wait a long time to be seen. I really would recommend other people  to come to your office..	2
Dr. Lal is an excellent doctor. He listens so well and cares about his patients. I am thankful to have found him and get a diagnosis so quickly. I would highly recommend him to anyone. 	2

"I have been coming to this practice since 2009 - 9 years!  For someone with my personality, it says a lot.  I take my health pretty seriously and equality important is the quality of care and concern that a Doctor should provide his or her patient.
I have found Dr. Kane to be a very great Doctor who cares about me (his patient), listens to me and provides quality care and follow-up.  I highly recommend Dr. Kane for anyone looking for a GI specialist."	2
My experience with Dr. Kane has been excellent. He and his staff are 5 stars! I highly recommend him to ANYONE. You will leave very satisfied with your care. 	2
He is honest and straight-forward. He has been my go-to Doctor for 15 years and he has resolved the majority of my GI issues! 	2

"He is the sweetest Doctor EVER. He has a great personality and takes great care of me! You have to call him ""Slick"" in the procedure room because he's THAT skilled! "	2
Dr  Kane is my hero. Why? Because he was straight forward with me, he was honest and he supports my health improvements. He spoke to me about the reshape program and how it could help me get back on track. He planted the seed and left it there. When I mentioned it again on another visit, he gave all the information and we moved forward. His office staff are all supportive and professional. I recommend his practice to everyone. 	2
"""Listen to the patient'
Following the ER, I was referred to Dr. Kane.  Although it took some time to get in to see him -- his patient care was worth the wait.  My 1st appointment lasted almost 1.45 hours and I didn't care!  Dr. Kane thoroughly reviewed my summaries and labs, and ordered additional tests 'stat' (only ever heard that on TV). Despite 'normal' scans/labs, Dr. Kane's approach to 'Listen to the Patient' quickly got me into surgery, out of pain, and onto recovery. Thank you Dr. Kane!!"	2
i met Dr KANE after I was discharged from the hospital without a diagnosis but suffering with unremitting vomiting. He agreed to see me immediately working me in at the lunch hour. In 24 hours he knew what was wrong and brought things under control. For the last 15 plus year he has been taking care of me and I have sent my family members and close friends to him.  I have worked in the health field for 40 years and I am very picky selecting providers and I recommend Dr KANE without reservation. 	2
Dr. Kane has been an answer to a prayer for my husband and I.  He is very knowledgeable, upbeat and has a great sense of humor.  He has performed procedures on me that other doctors said they were not able to do, and without any difficulties.  He makes you feel safe, and that any problems will be found and taken care of.  Dr. Kane is truly the best!!!	2
Dr. Marcus is one of the best doctors. My nurse colleague recommended him for colonoscopy. He found a growth which would normally be difficult to find. Meticulous, genuinely caring. Because of him I am now recovering from surgery. If left untreated could have developed into serious consequences later on. So grateful for him. He is a doctor who joined the profession for the right reasons. To help people. Thank you. 	2
"I highly recommend this doctor! 
Compassionate! Friendly staff! "	2
Dr. Marcus is AWESOME!!! Both he & his Physician’s Assistant, Tiphanie are very thorough & have a great bedside manner. The front desk staff are also very friendly! Highly recommend this doctor!!  	2
"Always waiting more than 3 hours. Ops schedule for 10 they don't start till 2pm. 

Staff and nurses are incompetence, ask the same questions over and over. No one writes anything down. "	0
Dr. Marcus is one of the best doctors I've ever seen in the US. Not only he is very knowledgeble but also patient and warm. He takes time to explain everything to the patient and always with the best bed manners!	2
It's very rare you get such a thorough doctor that is so kind.  Went for a routine colonoscopy, met with the doctor before and after and felt this doctor really takes his time. 	2
Considering the  professionalism , excellent care, the compassion, and respect I received I would highly recommend Dr Marcus to all my friends and family. I am so grateful for having been referred to him. He put me at ease and made me feel like I was in the best care I could be in. 	2

Dr. Avika Marcus is an oustanding doctor who takes the time to explain what is going on and how he plans to treat it.  Not to mention his warm and friendly personality.  But before choosing a doctor take the time to read his/her credentials!  He is both a MD and a PhD from highly regarding universities, and continues to be involved in medical research and writing.  I have total confidence in Dr. Marcus.	2
Very pleasant visit. Easy to talk to with very good communication skills	2
Dr. Marcus was very informative and it was enlightening talking to him he made me feel comfortable and gave me peace of mind I truly felt I was in good care with him.	2
My first impression of Dr. Marcus is very positive. Unfortunately my previous doctor did not send my medial records in a timely mannor, so Dr. Marcus didn't have a large picture of my medical care however, I felt very comfortable and look forward to my next appointment to discuss a solid treatment plan. 	2
Rare combination of great bedside manner and outstanding medical care. A very approachable and concerned man. Explained conditions, covered cost options and gave alternatives for care. 	2

We were very pleasantly surprised with the professionalism of all of the staff ..  none of us like to discuss Staci Mach issue but they were great with their questions and diagnosis .. we trust them thouroughly !!	2
 Dr Monzel has recently been treating my father with serious medical GI issues. I flew in from out of state because of the seriousness of the issues with my father. While in the Dr. office with my father and brother, there was a sense of relief, lifted off my shoulders when Dr Monzel spoke, he knew what needed to be done, and has hope in my fathers recovery. My father was seen in ICU and Dr Monzel and his  team were right on top of my dads treatment and in contact with other Drs. GREAT TEAM 	2
Dr. Monzel is one of a kind. He has been there for my family in a way that no money in the world can buy. He has inspired and cared for my kids dad with such sensitivity and care.

Dr. Kuryan is the ultimate professional.  I was highly impressed with his expertise and felt completely comfortable in his warm presence to ask questions.  He has such high regard for his patients that he takes his time, giving 100% attention to the patient.  I found him very soothing in a situation that can feel quite uncomfortable.  He is a top doc!	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Kuryan for 7 years and I feel so lucky to have him as a Dr. I have never met a Dr. that spends so much time making sure his patients are doing well. He personally calls me on the phone to discuss results and to check in to see how I am feeling after procedures or hospitalizations. He always responds in a timely manner to the patient portal emails and has incredible bedside manner, especially when discussing sensitive decisions that need to be made. By far the best!	2
Dr. Kuryan is fantastic. His bedside manner is wonderful, very kind and compassionate.  The office staff is excellent too. They are friendly and so very helpful!	2

I wouldn't even consider going to another doctor for the areas she's so well versed and proficient in!!	2
Dr. Parsons immediately identified a somewhat rare pancreatic condition and confirmed his suspicions quickly as a diagnosis after an invasive procedure. He referred me to his surgical colleague, immediately. That accelerated diagnosis and prompt follow-up attention probably saved my life. I am grateful for his directness and the urgency with which he handled my case.	2
Very, very confident in Dr. Parsons , he was thorough wnd responsive to my questions. Very caring and helpful in all aspects of the treatment that I needed.	2

I took my mother to see Dr. Treyzon and was blown away.  He is brilliant, kind, caring, knowledgeable, and extremely thorough. He took time to explain everything clearly. My mom thought he was hands down the best doctor she has ever seen.	2
My visit with Dr Treyzon was fantastic. His office is ran very efficiently and the staff are friendly and helpful. Dr. Treyzon himself was great; he was very clear, succinct and laid out a clear road map of my treatment. He was easy to talk to and I felt comfortable with my treatment plan when I left his office. I also really like how I am able to communicate with Dr. Treyzon through his messaging portal.	2

Very helpful visit.  Excellent patient communications.   Thoughtful advice.	2
My GI issues started when I was 14. That was 20 years ago. Over the years I have been to numerous physicians and GI docs.  Dr Treyzon is hands down the best GI Dr I have ever been to and probably the single best Dr I have met.  He has helped me treat SIBO, an ulcer, and called in numerous favors with a number of specialists when I had unexplained liver enzyme increases for a month and spent a week in two different hospitals.  He is at the top of his field, & yet has a humility and bedside manner	2
You want a doc with attentive patient care?  Dr. Treyzon is your guy!	2
Dr. Treyzon's front office is disorganized and irresponsible.  The person who reviews insurance information and office forms/policy neglected to tell my son of the $400 out-of-pocket fee the doctor charges before the initial appointment.  A $400 consultation fee is absolutely outrageous, especially when not informed of it prior to arrival at the doctor's office.	0
Best doctor I have ever been to. He has it all: knowledge, kindness, efficiency, judgment, and most importantly, he gave me hope that I would get better. I am still being treated by him as we methodically follow his plan for healing. His portal email system is so helpful and eliminates misunderstandings. If you have a GI issue, I would only see Dr. Treyzon. 	2
Dr. Treyzon has incredible expertise, and is an exceptionally thorough physician. His approach is to treat the whole patient - not just the symptoms. He is a physician who always thinks through all the possibilities, does all the necessary tests, and listens to his patients. He is VERY responsive, and you are never left waiting for results, or a call. His staff is on top of it, and he always makes himself available - despite his busy practice.  Our whole family sees him - we are so lucky!	2
I have known Dr. Treyzon for 8 years. He took care of my daughter when she was hospitalized and had GI complications after spinal surgery. He was really helpful and warm in our moment of need. We were so impressed with him then, that the whole family started seeing him. My husband, daughter, and I have all had procedures without any problems. it was a nice experience, as good as that can be. Dr. Treyzon is one of a kind in that he listens to my own perspective and my preferences for how to addre	2
Dr. Treyzon is amazing!! He made what could have been a very uncomfortable procedure easier... Very personable..  I've had two Colonoscopy/Endoscopies with him...  	2
Very good doctor, takes his time to ensure you understand what is going on. 	2

One of the best. Great bedside manner, and a gentle gastroenterologist. I' v been a patient of his for 15 years and think he' s a great doctor. I have referred friends to him.	2
"I came to Dr. Giurdji whom I know from way back the early eighties we both worked at USC.
He also treated my wife years ago. So, now, of course,  I came to him with my recent GI problems.  He quickly suspected a condition that I was not aware even existing. And sure the tests he advised  were positive.
I will gladly and without any hesitation recommend him to anybody with a GI problem..

Dr. Goren "	2

I had a very caring and professional treatment by Dr. Mahajan. I strongly recommend anybody for his expert services in Gastroenterology.	2
Procedures were painless with no post-event effects.  Explained before and at follow-up.	0
I was able to obtain an appointment with Dr. Mahajan within two days of a referral from my GP. He was professional but also very kind and caring. The same applies to his staff. I was incredibly impressed that he has Saturday hours to accommodate those who cannot miss work. 	2
I Highly recommend Dr. Ravish Mahajan. Dr. Mahajan is very considerate of patients timing and concerns and schedules appointments quickly.  Dr. Mahajan is very kind, explains the situation clearly and aims for the least invasive remedy. He answers questions and I never felt he was rushing through my questions. Felt very comfortable with him and his knowledge. 	2
Very thorough and thoughtful.  Office is efficient and very fast at responding.  I arrived a few minutes late and they accommodated me.  Highly suggest going to see him.	2
"Dr. Mahajan is an excellent doctor. He genuinely cares about his patients. 
Several years ago I had a hospital stay. He was the specialist that cared for me Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. He did a procedure on the weekend and then stayed around to talk to me about it. He was kind, attentive, and answered my many questions, I continue to return to him for check ups. He is amazing.
He has SATURDAY OFFICE HOURS. He does this to be available to his patients."	2
I met Dr. Mahajan for colonoscopy as part of annual checkup. He explained the bowel prep details very clearly and provided printed instructions easy to follow at home. He allowed me to split the laborious prep time to two days rather than one in order to ease the physical strain. After performing colonoscopy, he interpreted the results in simple terms. Now I can continue to lead a healthy life. Dr. Mahajan’s dedicated service to this community will stand tall for years to come.	2
My primary doctor made the appointment for me and Dr. Mahajan’s staff called us the appointment date and time. They then sent me all the procedures to prepare for the colonoscopy. I met Dr. Mahajan the first time on the morning of my colonoscopy. While preforming the procedure he professionally removed an infected polyp. He is a very caring doctor as following a problem I created by not following a liquid diet he came to St. Elizabeth ER early on a Saturday morning. I highly recommending him 	2
"My husband had an urgent health issue and required the services of a gastroenterologist.  Dr. Mahajan was able to get my husband's procedures scheduled quickly, diagnosed the problem and assisted with referral to the appropriate healthcare provider.

Dr. Mahajan was very respectful and kind when dealing with my family.  "	2
I just completed my 2nd colonoscopy with Dr. Mahajan.  Dr. Mahajan is very professional before, during and after procedures.  I trust him to take care of me and my family members.  Dr. Mahajan is also very thorough and precise in his work.  	2
Dr. Mahajan is outstanding--professionally competent, gentle, compassionate, warm, and reassuring. His pre-procedure instructions are concise and clear, and he and his staff are patient and thorough in listening and responding to my husband's and my numerous questions. We recommend him wholeheartedly and sincerely --and enthusiastically.	2
I would most certainly recommend Dr. Mahajan.   He has been very kind and patient with me.  He listens to my issues and comments.  He prompt when returning calls and email messages.	2
Very caring and gentle doctor. I took my 93 year old father in-law in for treatment and he was able to improve his quality of life 100%. Thank you Dr Mahajan!	2
"I had not been to a doctor for 40 years. I practice natural medicine. I have done yoga, walk 30 miles a week for 49 years. I am 68 years old. I had a problem and my GP recommended me to Dr. Mahayana.
My experience with his staff and Doctor Mahayana was truly way more than I good have imagined. Being in the legal field I went prepared with questions and the answered were given to me without an attitude. His staff gave me exact procedures for my test and the kindness from them was overwhelming."	2
I highly recommend Dr.Mahajan and his staff. Dr. Mahajan has always provided a sympathetic, understanding  and caring environment. He listens to my concerns and always ask questions. I want to thank Dr.Mahajan for his great care. 	2
I would recommend him I was having problems and he has got me back on track. And keeps me up to date and going. I am very satisfied with him.	2

My wife and I have been treated by Dr. Hernandez for several years. We both have been very satisfied with the treatment we have received. we highly recommend Dr Hernandez.	2
I was referred to Frederick Gastroenterology for a screening colonoscopy and they scheduled me for a full diagnostic procedure instead.  They asked me if I had any changes in toilet habits and I said nothing except a month prior, my entire family had a stomach virus and got over it.  What sort of clinic performs a diagnostic colonoscopy when a family has a few days of upset stomach?	1
Dr. Hernandez is not only a fantastic doctor; she also has that personal touch to her responses to questions that make me feel that she is truly (as she is) interested in my wellbeing.  She explains everything in down-to-earth terms which makes it easy to follow through with the medications and procedures without the normal jitters.	2

Dr. Colturi has been my physician since 2000. He is the most compassionate and professional I know. He had expertly treated all of my disorders. 	2
Dr. Razavi is excellent. My husband and I had a colonoscopy within a few weeks of one another. I did the research, and Dr. Razavi was by far our choice based on reviews--and he did not disappoint. He's warm, gracious, caring, and, most important, competent. We also appreciated those qualities from the anesthesiologist and his staff. From the moment we called the office to make an appointment until after we left the office and receive a follow-up call to ensure we were doing well. All we can say is TOP NOTCH!	2
I had my colonoscopy on the 23th of September. It was a great experience. I  was very nervous at first, but the wonderful nurse made it so easy for me. He was very comforting; also, the anesthesiologist was fantastic: very friendly and professional. Of course, I cannot forget the king, Dr. Razavi, he is very knowledgeable and caring. He called me personally to discuss any details following the procedure. I will recommend him to anyone who needs a Gastroenterologist. Dr. Razavi is the best, and the staff is wonderful.	2
Dr. Razavi is one of the best, if not the best, physicians in his field. He was very thorough in treating me for problems revolving around residual effects from my recovery from cancer.

"Dr. Razavi has been an amazing doctor who has provided 
medical services for me for over 15 years.  There is no other
doctor that I trust more.  He takes the time to explain things
thoroughly, but most importantly he cares.  He has called me 
back personally after-hours and on weekends to check up on me.  
He has listened to and answered all of my questions and concerns over the years.  
He goes out of his way to give you the best care, I have referred my entire family to him.

Now I have lactose tolerance Zero. I cannot eat any milk product. I cannot digest food properly. I am more sick than before.	0
If you are looking for a knowledgeable and experienced gastroenterologist, Dr. Razavi is your man.   He is kind, compassionate, and does not talk down to his patients.  .

What does one do when they hear the word ‘cancer?’  Scream, cry, go into shock?  Well, I heard the word and did the opposite. Although I was, of course, scared, Dr. Razavi detected my colorectal cancer and gave me the most fantastic care and support one could ask for. He is simply the very best.

He never just ""assumes"" with your symptoms but will get to the root cause to base his diagnosis and treatment.  Dr Razavi has been my GI specialist for a number of years and also my Mom.  I will always refer him to anyone that is in need of his speciality.  Selfishly I can only hope that Dr Razavi never retires.  "	2
DR. Razavi is the most experienced Gastroenterology that we both have been to. My wife and I have been a patience of his since 1997. Hes a very professional doctor and cares about the health of his patients. When either one of us to go he always ask about the other one by the first name. He sits down and look at the chart and discuss and health issues that we have questions on. His staff is very friendly and professional.	2

"We moved to this area 6 years ago. My wife and I had a history of various gastro problems. We knew from prior experience that it was important to find an experienced Gastroenterologist, but wanted someone who would also listen to us and explain procedures.  Dr. Razavi is not only very experienced and skilled but believes in informing his patients of the diagnosis and any procedures in a caring and compassionate way.

My diabetes provider gave me Dr. Rasavi's name for Gastroenterology. She told me many of  her patients liked him very much, so I booked an appointment with him. The day I came into Dr. Rasavi's office I was not feeling very well at all.  He surmised that my stomach issues could be my heart so he sent me to see a heart doctor that same day.  He was right. It was a heat issue. I am totally grateful to him for thinking of what his patient needed more than his own practice. he took care of my issues	2
"What can I say? I will always believe the good doctor helped save my life 10 years ago. I met him at the local hospital at night while he was making his rounds checking on some of his patients. He gave me his business card and 8 months later I made an appointment. By this time my health had gotten so bad he made arrangements to get me to Georgetown University Hospital ASAP. Only wish my other doctor had been that competent!

Thanks Doctor Razavi!
"	2
Dr. Razavi, wow, where do I start. First he look over my records, then my history. He then took charge on informing me of what might have. Be he always wanted to make sure and very thorough. Dr. Razavi is very kind, with a wit of humor but explained everything, my procedure, the outcome. He made me feel that I was in good hands. Dr. Razavi team of nurses were superb, professional, also informed me exactly what to expect and the outcome. But the kindness, to make me feel comfortable and relaxed.	2
My initial visit with Dr. Razavi was for an ongoing issue that seemed to have no resolution after various visits and treatments over 11 months time. That same day, I tested and reassured that the condition was treatable with antibiotics. I also felt that I was in very competent, capable, professional hands. His follow-up visits were excellent and at all times I was informed of my progress and test results. He is highly recommended.  	2
I had two separate treatment.  I was terrified of the first (colonoscopy). Dr Razavi explained the procedure in detail.  After the procedure, he spent time explaining scope findings. I was impressed.  As to the second treatment, Dr. Razvi interviewed  me in detail, diagnosed quickly, and even explained the treatment plan, my prescriptions and how it works.  He took ownership in my recovery.  He also has very pleasant and competent front office and PA staff. I would recommend him in a heartbeat. 	2
Dr Razavi is the absolute best doctor.  He is extremely caring of his patients and will do everything possible to resolve any issues you are having.  Three years ago I had ulcerative colitis and Dr Razavi put me on several meds and last colonoscopy showed no signs.  I highly recommend Dr Razavi to everyone.  I wish all doctors could be more like him.	2
Dr. Razavi recently found a cancerous polyp in a routine colonoscopy.  He called me to his office the day he got the results.  I  could tell from his voice something was wrong he seemed to be hurt at having to tell be about the cancer.  I was very impressed at how Dr. Razavi helped me find a surgeon and the way he put things in motion with the hospital.  My surgery was done two weeks after the diagnosis.  Dr. Razavi even visited me while in recovery.  I am now cancer free thanks Doc.	2
Dr. Razavi was exceptionally attentive, paying attention to my concerns and  offering thoughtful consultation and practical advice. I find that unusual in this era of managed care.	2
I had the endoscopy first.  When I arrived everything was in place for my endoscopy.  I was taken to the OR. The lady handed me a gown, and showed me where I could put my clothes. The atmosphere was friendly and my worries disappeared. I had a restful sleep and woke up happy.  I had no idea that the procedure had been done! I felt happy that we were finished and felt relaxed.   I was glad to go back and get the colonoscopy done!! No worries at all.  I am so grateful to Dr. Razavi and his team. ?	2
Dr Razavi has been my gastroenterologist for 5 years!  he is expereinced and extremely professional and caring.

Was very satisfied with Dr Kieth Jr. he explain my procedures and answered all my questions	2
I highly recommend Dr. Keith. I am very skeptical when it comes to doctors due to bad experiences, so when I needed a Gastrologist I asked around. One co-worker highly recommended Dr. Keith and now I know why. He and his staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Any one of them would take  the time to answer any and all questions I had. Getting through the couple of procedures I needed done was easy due to the compassionate demeanor of him and his staff, putting my mind and nerves at ease.	2
Thorough and easy to understand.	2
I have always had a positive experience with treatment and consultations..	2

Dr Keith is down to earth and asks the right questions and gives information and options that are easy to understand. Office staff were all nice, friendly and professional.	2
I think He's a great dr. But be careful of what he writes in for codes for the procedures you are having. Mine was incorrect, and I am now in the middle of trying to get a large sum of money back for this error.	2
Went to Dr Keith after going well over a year with different Doctor not finding gall bladder issues, he found it first visit.	2
I am very pleased with Dr. Keith. I had to wait a few weeks to get an appointment. That's probably because he is so good. I am happy that my patience paid off.	2
I am happy with Dr. Keith and with his practice.  Dr. Keith performed two surgical procedures and both went very well.  	2
Dr. Keith is an excellent gastroenterologist.  He listened to my complaints and has the appropriate testing completed to determine my medical issues.  He has an excellent bedside manner and I will continue to go to Dr. Keith as necessary.	2
Dr. Keith reviewed past medical records, listened patiently to the symptoms that I described and made recommendations on dietary restriction and prescribed medication that had an immediate and positive effect on my condition. Will visit him again, if necessary, and highly recommend. Him for other gastro patients.	2
I have seen Dr Keith twice in the last year and both times the experience has been very reassuring.  He is personable and took the time to make sure I understood the diagnosis.  He took care to explain things to me and let me know what to expect moving forward.  	2
"I was very pleased with Dr Keith's professional and friendly demeanor.  He had a friendly and warm
handshake  which is always a plus.  I have postponed having a co lonoscopy as my earlier years I had
a sigmoidoscope, which was not a pleasant experience ( it was many yrs ago in Conn.) 

But it left me with fear and dread  in having this very important part of our health care.   

Thank You!  Helen J. Daly









"	2
Dr. Keith is very helpful. He listens and explains very clearly. His bedside manner is wonderful. 	2
I would recommend Dr. Keith to anyone who is looking to have a upper or lower GI test.  I had them both done on the same visit and was pleased with the proficient service I received.  He and his staff were very helpful and friendly.	2
"Dr. keith was excellent  I will continue to go to him.  Even with the 45 minute  drive   

Thank You
Raymond"	2
Very quick and efficient, took time to explain the procedures and results.	2
Dr. Keith is a very caring professional doctor.	2
My first appointment went well.  I appreciated how I was treated and the information.  Dr kieth doesn't seem to waste any time, but he also doesn't make you feel rushed.  That is a talent.  I haven't had any procedures done or found out what is wrong yet so my review is only regarding a one time visit.  The staff scheduled my procedure before I left the office.	2
"Dr Keith and his entire staff were true professionals. From the minute I entered the facility I felt very comfortable. Everyone explained exactly what I could expect and every movement was explained. 

Dr Keith spoke with me prior to the procedure and then again afterward. He took the time to answer all my questions and he explained specifically what he found during the procedure. 

This was my first colonoscopy so I was a little apprehensive.  No need - they made it easy. "	2
Our first visit and Dr Sprung was so  thorough and  personable. He made us feel comfortable and we  appreciated his knowledge of my problem.	2
I appreciate Dr Sprung’s approach and his level of knowledge. I’m impressed with the way he treats me as a patient and the time that he takes to provide such thorough care. His staff are professional, friendly and giving of their time. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for a gastroenterologist. I feel blessed to have found them	2
Dr. Sprung is awesome.  He is very compassionate and knowledgeable and puts you at ease.	2
He cared about what was going on in my life. He used this to determine proper treatment. He is always friendly in a lovely way. His staff are also lovely and are thorough whether performing duties in the front office or in the patient room. You can even join them on Facebook. Everything is clean and neat, including the bathroom. Overall, the best Doctor and office staff to which I've ever been.	2
Personable and pleasant from the moment I checked in.	2
"Dr. Sprung is an ""old school"" physician.  He takes time with his patients, explains everything, and is direct but very congenial.  The office staff is professional, and I did not feel the ""assembly line"" experience that I have had with other practices.  I was not rushed and all of my concerns were addressed.  I recommend him highly."	2
First visit with dr sprung. Very thorough doctor. You can tell he truly cares for and wants the best for his patients.	2
He is wonderful and truly cares. I will not see anyone else for my gastro needs.	2
Dr. Sprung is the best doctor for gastro problems. Has been my doctor for many years. Easy to talk to and actually listens to you. I recommend him to anyone that has stomach issues.	2

Just a really nice guy that knows what he's doing.    	2

Dr Sprung is a Doctor that listens. Just a great Doctor 	2
From the first phone encounter with the receptionist I was made to feel comfortable and in a caring, welcoming environment.  My first visit with Dr. Sprung was a continuation of that goodwill.  Add to that his easy yet professional manner and the many years of experience and I feel very fortunate to have found him.  He listened carefully and replied with current research and anecdotal expertise. The office is small with personal attention making you feel special by all you encounter.	2
I have seen numerous gastroenterologists over the years and I feel most confident with Dr. Sprung by far. I feel like I can breathe a sigh of relief to be in his care. He is very knowledgeable and his expertise gives me peace of mind. 	2
Dr. Sprung and staff are knowledgeable, courteous, professional and punctual. 100% recommendation.	2
totally professional, personal from the phone to the office to the Doctor. This  was my wife and my first visit and we have no doubts about Dr Sprung's qualifications, thoroughness and should we need to be treated ASAP the system would be seamless. Extremely impressed	2
Great experience. Very professional.	2
very poor never even took my blood pressure or temperature or my wait , after i left his office i ended up at urgent care this doctor is living in the past very poor treatment	0

Jose Acosta"	2
I had my first visit with Dr. Sprung yesterday. He was very thorough in his analysis of my condition and I believe I am in care of a great Dr. He actually cared to explain the details with me and made sure all of my questions were answered. 	2

Excellent--Dr. Sprung listens to my concerns, explains my condition clearly and is genuinely concerned with his patients' well-being.  He keeps up-to-date with the latest developments in his field and is very knowledgeable.  The office staff also is excellent--they answer questions and return phone calls promptly.	2
I believe Dr. Sprung has the good of his patient at heart.  He is very courteous and professional in his care.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Sprung's for over 25 years.  I would not ever go to another Gastroenterologist.  In my opinion he is the absolute best!	2
My husband just had his first appointment with Dr. Sprung and he and I were immediately inpressed with his thoroughness during the appointment.  He truly took the time to listen to my husband and determine what his chief concerns were.  Also, the office staff were all attentive and kind as well.	2
Dr. sprung and his staff are excellent. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Dr. Sprung is calm thorough and very caring. He has taken wonderful care of me for many years. I highly recommend him.	2

"He is the best gastrointestinal doctor. He takes time to explain and always calls back. He is thorough and if you need an annual colonoscopy he is the best, his office staff is friendly and helpful. His facility is state of the art. He makes a necessary procedure a non event.  I highly recommend  Dr. Sprung.
"	2
He is very nice and his staff is great!  	2
Dr. Sprung is wonderful! I was very impressed with him when he preformed my first colonoscopy four years ago.  I was very nervous about the prep and procedure because I am small in stature and another doctor told me that it would be difficult to do.  Dr. Sprung made me feel very comfortable.  I am now going through another procedure and I feel confident that he will take care of my new medical issue. When a doctor calls you on a Saturday, you know that he cares. His office staff is awesome too!	2
"Dr. Sprung mage me instantly know he was listening and completely 
understood my description of my situation.  I have 100% confidence."	2
Dr. Sprung is in my opinion and experience a wonderful physician and I highly recommend him.  I have been a patient for many years.  He is thorough, kind, and reassuring.  	2
This office really cares, the staff are both kind and understanding and the doctor is extremely knowledgeable and attentive. 	2
Dr Sprung listens and cares about his patients.  My husband and I have been going to him for many years for colonoscopies. Would recommend him very highly.	2

"I found Dr. Sprung to have a wonderful personality
He listened to what I had to say and is knowledge on my GI condition (Crohn's)
I also found the entire staff and his nurse to be very friendly and caring to the patients as was Dr. Sprung 
"	2
staff is friendly and helpful, very little wait time, doctor took interest in explaining prescriptions & options	2
Dr. Sprung has been my wife's doctor for several years and was also my mothers doctor before her passing.  I had been using another doctor, but when that doctor retired I scheduled with Dr. Sprung.  My first experience with him was very positive and I would recommend him to anyone needing a Gastroenterologist. 	2
These are the most wonderful people in medicine we have ever experienced. Since 2010 when Dr. Sprung performed my husband's and my colonoscopies we have sung his praises to everyone. Now, all our local family members go to him and also love him. Even friends who  are happy with their gastro physician have taken what we told them about Dr. Sprung's procedures to their doctors for consideration. Now I am going to him for medical issues and have complete confidence in him. No one else will do.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Sprung for over a decade. He has consistently been very knowledgeable, personable, and attentive to my condition. I highly recommend him. 	2
Dr. Sprung has been my Gastroenterologist since 1989.  I cannot imagine going to anyone else!  He's very professional and yet very easy to talk with.  He has kept my colitis under control (for almost 30 years) after a serious episode which landed me in the hospital for a month.	2
I love Dr. Hunt also. He is the best physician; compassionate and kind. Very thorough and knowledgeable. Highly recommended.	2
I am confident that I am getting the best treatment. Dr Hunt listens and I feel really wants to improve my health. He always make sure all my concerns are addressed and explains what I need so I understand. I highly recommend him to my family and friends	2
I love Dr. Hunt.  He listens well, diagnoses well, and follows through with great treatments.  He explains everything thoroughly.  I have confidence in him.	2
I have had a colonoscopy every 5 years since 2000 colon cancer surgery and have been cancer free since 2000 after surgery. Dr Apter has done a fantastic job of watching over my health and I feel blessed that he is my gastroenterologist. 	2
"The staff and this doctor have no compassion or empathy.  I was extremely worried about something and thought it might be cancer.  It happened on the weekend.  I called the answering service to have the doctor call me.  Darlene called back and told me they couldn't find me in the system and asked if I was his patient.  I said I was and had a colonoscopy three years ago.  She said ""you haven't seen him in
three years!""  Well he might not call you back"".  Before I could tell her that I had no reason to see him unless I had a gastroenterology issue, she hung up on me.  I called back and the next person said the doctor would call me.  He called and told me to do a few things and to call his office Monday morning and he comes in at 1:00 and I could see him Monday afternoon.  When I called the office Monday, I got the same unprofessional treatment.  They said he would not see me and that I needed a surgeon without him even looking at the issue.  Ladies, find a female doctor. "	0
My husband was diagnosed with UC a year ago. Our former gastro. no longer accepts our insurance so we were recommended Dr Apter by a current patient. When we called to schedule a new patient appointment today, his front desk person named Sharon informed us that he is not seeing patients with a dx of UC. I said “excuse me what?” She repeated herself. I clarified that this was indeed the Gastroenterolgist Dr Apter, which she said yes but “he chooses to no longer see patients w/UC” Interesting.	1
Dr. Apter is one of the finest doctors I have ever known.  He has been my Gastro doctor for 30 years. He is a skilled professional, has a great attitude towards his patients and has a wonderful and caring staff. If you need Gastro care he is the one you need to see. His colorful bow ties will cheer you up even before he begins to care for your medical needs. 	2
So glad I found him....down to earth, honest, knowledgeable, easy to talk to about embarrassing gastro issues...he couldn't get any better. Great patient/ Doctor relationship	2
"Dr. Apter used to be my doctor from 1995 to 2006. He’s a excellent doctor.
I missed him very much ??????????., he’s not only extraordinary  doctor but very caring person. He’s truly care about his patient."	2
While Dr. Apter was perfectly pleasant, his prognosis was completely inaccurate. Had I not gone to another doctor, my gallbladder may have burst. He was thorough after the exam in terms of explaining things, but didn't believe, after I showed him where I was having pain, that it was gallstones. I exhibited tell tale signs of gallstones, so I'm very upset that this was overlooked, and I was not given an ultrasound. I will not be returning.	0
Best Gastroenterologist I have been to. I have been a patient of his since 1996 and recommend him to anyone that needs to see a Gastro. He is always kind, always listens, and makes you feel comfortable while talking about some uncomfortable things.	2
I saw Dr. Apter approximately 6 years ago, and was very pleased with his care.  Because of that I called to make an appt. for another colonoscopy on July 13, 2017.  I gave my new insurance info.  I was told I didn't need to come into the office, and they would verify my insurance.  At 11:30 a.m. the day before my procedure I was called by Bonnie (office mgr) that they do not accept my insurance.  I was told that it was my job to check, and I was lucky she found it before my procedure!!!	2
I would and will recommend Dr. Apter.  His bedside manner and his medical explanations were wonderful.	2
Never met a more caring and knowledgeable doctor; friendly down to earth personality.	2
Such a caring, compassionate Doctor! Sense of humor set me at ease immediately. Actually listened to me and thorough diagnostic testing. Feeling so much better! Office staff is responsive and friendly! Would recommend to everyone!	2
Dr. Apter is very patient focused and is an extremely knowledgeable and excellent doctor.	2
I saw Dr. Rogers for the first time today and he was great!! He sat next to the medical table (that I sat on) and carefully explained everything to me! He’s thorough and knowledgeable! He asked repeatedly if I or my husband had any questions. He made small talk/conversation to take my mind off of the reason why I was there. Great, young, Neurologist!  I was lucky to get a same day appt with him! 	2
"I saw Dr. Rodgers twice so far. Each time it felt as if he was my primary care doctor. Him & his staff are the BEST I've seen in a very long time. Now, I'm just waiting on him to fix me, but i had to write a review to let others know how great these people are. 
Thank you Dr. C,
Scarlett Langridge 
 "	2
"I have been in great pain for a couple of months.  I went to Dr. Rogers office and he was so  patient.  After a couple of test I'am doing much better.  
From the front desk recipient to his assistant  those ladies will put you at ease. 
What a great doctor and group of people. 
Thank you Eva "	2
I've had random problems most of my life and kept getting diagnosed with different things I started having seisures two neurologist didn't know why but when I saw doctor Roger's after my test results he diagnosed me with ms explaining every problem I've ever had he's an amazing doctor and such a sweet person 	2
Saw Dr. Youn for bleeding in my head during my trip.  I was recommended to her from the ER in a small town in AZ and was transferred to Barrow's Institute  And couldn't be more pleased with the experience. She is not only skilled but kind, thorough and accessible. Couldn't have found a better doctor and I'm so thankful!	2
Brilliant doctor - best of all, compassionate and caring. I felt like she saw me as a person and not just a chart number! Two thumbs up for Dr. Youn!	2
Dr Youn is very caring and took the time to listen to my symptoms.  I feel like she really understood how to make my quality of life better and help me connect with resources i needed. Thank you Dr Youn. 	2
Easy to talk to, very considerate of my conditions. Felt comfortable during consultation and gave me fresh perspectives my other doctors couldn't.	2
Great doctor and office. Dr. Youn was caring, compassionate, and had excellent bedside manners. She took her time explaining things to me, really listened to and addressed my concerns. Glad to have found such a good doctor!	2
Cares and provides great explanation. No questions unanswered. Glad to have her as my doc.	2
Compassionate doctor you cares for your health, and also sees you as a person!	2
Dr. Hedges has been my doctor for about 15 years.  She is very compasionate and listens to your concerns.  I couldn't ask for a better neurologist.  I would recommend her to anyone.	2
Dr. Hedges has a calming presence that keeps me calm. She is very smart and knows her career field. When I ask her about some new development that might help me she usually has knowledge of it and gives me her opinion. Above all she is a nice caring person. 	2
This is one of the greats. She is very helpful and informative. She makes you feel like you are heard and helps you get solutions to help you with pain if you are in pain as I am with back pain. I would highly recommend this doctor and this office.	2
My first visit ever to Dr Hedges was impressive.  Her nurse was very nice and friendly. Waiting room time was minimal. Dr Hedges was quite thorough.She was very personable and attentive. Very nice.	2
Great - very attentive and took time to listen	2
My visit was satisfying . Dr Hedges explained everything to me. She was very patient. She answered all my questions. She ordered to determine what is wrong. I thank and appreciate her.	2
Dr. Hedges is Wonderful she makes you feel at ease besides being Very knowledgeable in her field.	2
Great office all around.  Receptionist very nice and attentive.  Didn't wait but a couple minutes to see the Doctor.  Dr. Hedges was great.  Listened to me and she explained things to me and made sure I didn't have any questions before I left.	2
She is a very compassionate doctor who did a great job of diagnosing my issue.  I would highly recommend her!	2
Highly liklihood	1
Dr. Hedges is an amazing doctor who cares for her patients.	2
The staff in the office are very friendly and helpful and Dr. Hedges knows her stuff.  If something isn't working for you she will finds keeping trying something until she finds something that does.  Being going there for 4 years and haven't thought about going somewhere else for care.	2
"DATE: March 11, 2019
Dr. Kathryn Hedges, MD
Midwest Neuroscience Institute, Lee's Summit

I have been a patient of Dr. Hedges for nearly a decade.  She was at my bedside in the hospital on that day to explain her diagnosis based on an MRI taken at the ER the night before.  I was impressed with her keen intellect and ability to explain complex processes in a way that I could understand.  In subsequent years she has treated me as a person with a condition rather than just a patient.
M. Rowland"	2
Dr. Hedges is wonderful! She is attentive to all of my concerns and is extremely knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her. 	2
Dr. Hedges has been my neurologist since the 1990's.  She is treating my migraines.  She is kind, considerate, and extremely knowledgeable.  I am never rushed and it is so easy to talk with her.  She explains things so that I can understand them.  She takes her time with me.  I highly recommended Dr. Hedges	2
Dr. Hedges is a caring person who manages to explain complex neurological issues and, more importantly, solutions, without making you feel like she's talking over your head. It's a skill I wish all doctors had. Dr. Hedges is the reason I'm still walking, and without pain. She is currently helping me with my neuropathy, and I am so thankful for her. I cannot recommend Dr. Hedges more highly.	2
Dr. Hedges is amazing.  Her staff is friendly and helpful going above and beyond for the patients.  When my husband had a sudden memory loss, they got him in where others were telling me it would by 6 mos. before they could see him.	2
I have always been impressed with Dr. Hedges. She is thorough and personable. She provides excellent patient care.	2
I love Dr Hedges!  She takes the time to listen to you and your concerns.  She does not make you feel rushed. Dr Hedges and her staff are very pleasant, helpful and understanding. I feel so fortunate, so blessed to have found her.  	2
Dr Hedges is so easy to talk to, has a wealth of knowledge and ideas to share.  Dr. Hedges is passionate about helping people and finding out what is wrong. I would definitely recommend her!	2
"I would definitely recommend Dr. Hedges,
Reasons:
Keeps advised of all medications (new and older ones)
Knowledgeable (experience combined with intelligence)
Listens to her patients
Cares about her patients well being"	2
Dr Hedges is always so nice and takes as much time as we need.  Would highly recommend her.	2
Great Doctor, bedside manner, She really listens to what her patients say! She and her staff got me in to see her quickly and I appreciate not only Dr Hedges but her fabulous Staff...	2
Dr. Hedges listened and cared for my individual situation. Her eye contact and soft voice gave me calm reassurance that I was in a safe place and that everything was going to be alright.  She responded to my answers in a way that showed she understood what I was trying to tell her and she cared about solving the problem, not just doing a quick fix and sending me on my way.  	2
I had heard nice things about Dr. Hedges and was pleased when my doc referred me to her for headaches.  A very good listener, she diagnosed the problem and gave me three options for treatment.  #1 didn’t work, but it appears the second option is giving me near-total relief.  	2
"Dr. Hedges was very professional and pleasant. She tested my reflexes ask question about when this started and if family members had any of the same symptoms. She ruled out any disease and suggested a medicine that would treatment for me and told me the side effects and not wanting me to fill the prescription until a time had elapsed to see if I would get better without the med's.  Office staff were friendly and helpful.
Thanks Dr. Hedges"	2
I had a very good experience explained everything and even showed pictures listened to my concerns and answered my questions,has a action plan for a diagnosis.	2
Kind and caring. Very professional.	2
 I am  a patient of Dr Hedges for many years. She is medically an expert  as a neurologist .  Very compassionate , and provides the best listening ear to all your care and concerns that at times are not directed to her expertise.  She has a great sense of humor and makes you feel so at ease with every appointment.  I completely trust her and would not change my care to another neurologist because her spirit is contagious in a lovable way. She and her Staff are 5 Star ?? quality.  Thank You	2
"I visited Dr Hedges for headaches.  I have visited doctors for years and its always the same story.  Long waits in waiting room and 10 minutes tops with the doc while they look on their laptop.

This visit was different.  She actually explained to me about headaches thoroughly and then came up with a game plan on how we are gonna fix the problem.  iTs exactly what I needed and wanted.  I thank her for that.  I will be doing followup in mid January.  "	2
Dr Hedges is very easy to talk to.  She was very through in the exam and explained everything.  I will recommend to all who ask.	2
Dr. Hedges has a kind soul and takes the time to listen and research your health needs.  She is currently working to help find out what type of tremors are going on with my hand, shoulder, and head.  She helped send me in the right direction back in 1999 when I had a cancerous brain tumor and is probably one of the reasons I am still alive today.  Now in the year 2017 she is helping me find answers to my health care issues with certain tests that will provide us with answers on how to treat me. 	2
Dr. Hedges has helped me with my migraines.  She is a very knowledgeable physicians who is also friendly and kind to patients. I never have to wait in the waiting but maybe 1-2 minutes ever, and the whole staff is wonderful. 	2
Dr Hedges was very friendly and thorough during my visit. She took time and explained my possible condition to me.	2
 Dr. Hedges was very warm, receptive and knowledgeable to my concerns and questions.  I was very comfortable with her and her staff. 	2
Dr. Hedges is personable, genuinely interested in knowing her patients, gives plenty of time so there is not a hurried feeling and is extremely knowledgable and stays up to date on new medical developments.  We have great confidence in Dr. Hedges' care.	2
Dr. Hedges and her staff are very friendly and helpful and listen to my problems and specific symptoms and offer a variety of solutions. When one thing doesn't work, we would try another and discuss alternative treatment plans. I'm now two months migraine free (when my pharmacy refills my prescription, that is) and that is a first in five years.	2
 Dr. was Very nice, and took a lot of time with me with  my  initial exam	2
Dr Davis is the first doctor I’ve ever seen that really listened to why I was there and took time to ask questions about my medical problem. She looked into things nobody ever mentioned before. She didn’t rush or make me feel like she was in a hurry to move on to someone else. She explained things to me and my husband in words we could understand. She was polite and really kind. 	2
Dr DeJesus is the most caring physician I have ever met.  She is very thorough as well as knowledgeable in her field. She listens and answers all questions.  I would highly recommend her to anyone experiencing a movement disorder like Parkinsons.	2
He is very caring and listens to patients concerns	2
Dr. Guy Schwartz helped my dad and my dad bragged great things about Dr. Schwartz.  He is the best doctor and he is awesome	2
"Dr. Schwartz was very caring, intelligent, professional, and has a fabulous bedside manner.  Not an alarmist.  He asks you if you have any questions for him, explains everything in detail, is not rushing you, and covers all bases during his exam.  

I will be transferring care to his office.  His staff were an absolute delight.  What a difference from the office I had been receiving treatment from.  

My prior neorologist was a crackpot. Dr. Schwartz is a doctor's doctor.  "	2
"I was very impressed at the start, when Dr. Schwartz escorted me from the waiting room to the exam room. That was definitely a first.
He was very calming, wonderful patience, thoroughly explained everything I needed to know, and made the exam very comfortable.
I never once felt he was in a hurry, as is too often the case with other doctors. I am more than pleased with Dr Guy Schwartz as my Neurologist.
Respectfully,
Doris Costa"	2
Dr. Schwartz gave me a very thorough examination to test for Parkinson's Disease.  He told me that I had very slow moving Parkinson's.  There was no medication needed.  When I came back six months later, he again gave me a thorough exam and there was no change.  He is an excellent Doctor and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who needs a neurologist.  Dr. Schwartz spends as much time with you as you need and to me this is very important.  	2
Dr. Guy Schwartz is the best of the best.  If you are looking for an excellent Neurologist, he is the one to go to.  Well worth the trip from Queens all the way to E.Setauket. I have beengoing to him for years and he is very knowledgeable and caring about his Patients.  He does not rush through your  visit & takes the time to explain any questions you may have.  I wouldn't even think about going to someone closer just for convenience. 	2
Dr Schwartz was kind, caring and compassionate.  He is treating my mother for a-typical parkinson's disease and we have seen many doctors over the past three years.  He listened to everything we had to say and responded to every question with compassion and in terms we could understand.  He is not only knowledgeable but has a wonderful bedside manner.  We have yet to find that amazing combination when working with specialists in the field of movement disorders.  An overall wonderful experience!	2
"After a few years of no diagnosis I met Dr Schwartz.   One visit and I was diagnosed and treated. I followed him to Stoneybrook for continued treatment. He listens asks questions and gives full explanations and options. He and his office staff follow up and return all calls. . I trust him to help me get the best healthcare available and live life to the fullest.  He taught me ""Parkinson's is not a death sentence """	2
I have seen several doctors over the last few years for my condition.  Dr. Schwartz was attentive and listened to my complaints.  He was effective in treating me with better results than other doctors that I have seen.  I would highly recommend him.  	2
Excellent rapport with my special needs adult daughter and myself and is always willing to listen to our experience with her treatment between visits ( she receives Botox for torticollis - stiff and spasmed neck problem ). He is patient, fair, and treats patients as equals, suggesting and exploring treatments but never forcing them. Accommodates my daughter's day program scheduling needs. Mediates between patient and clerical staff about insurance labyrinths. Highly recommend him!! 	2
I found Dr. Schwartz to be a caring and attentive physician.  His examination was through and not rushed.  He was knowledgeable about the nature of my disorder and was able to assuage my concerns.  	2
Very thorough and caring.	2
Wonderful, patient, honest, humble, kind... He couldn't have been any nicer or any more thorough.  I've had many neurological issues and he is the finest dr I've found.  	2
Awesome doctor. Listen and explains everything to you. Definitely recommend to anyone who has migraines.	2
I was impressed with Dr. Hussain’s Professional approach and thorough explanation of my health issues.	2
Dr. Hussain is very professional but also quite personable. He helped us feel OK about a very difficult issue.	2
He is always polite and very efficient. He listens and finds the best methods to solve all of your concerns.	2
Dr. Hussain uses images and modern technology to really explain what is happening. It is his goal to make me part of the process, instead of just a patient being told what to do. I really feel like I am actively participating in my care and returning to good health. I can not give a higher recommendation.	2
Very personable. Informative and has been very helpful in finding solutions that work for my needs.	2
Dr. Hussain is very professional, personable and most importantly competent.  I highly recommend his practice.	2
Dr. Hussain and his staff set the bar for the rest of the medical community. I would not want to see another neurologist after finding Dr. Hussain.	2
"Dr. Nabeen Hussain, MD listens very well to understand my situation correctly. And also, he explains my situation clearly and easily with MRI image. 
This office is very tech based office and they respond very well with online messaging system. 
I strongly recommend him and his staffs."	2
"I was totally satisfied with staffs and DR.HUSSAIN. He explains very well with images. He also try very hard to understand his patient's situation correctly. 
I strongly recommend Dr. Nabeen Hussain."	2
Dr. Hussain is very professional and compassionate. His willingness to work with me, to take all of my concerns seriously, and allow me to ask questions through email was greatly appreciated. I would highly recommend him to anyone who needs a good neurologist. 	2
Great	2
I had a very pleasant experience seeing Dr. Hussain for my headaches. He was extremely detailed and methodical in asking about my symptoms and understanding my problems. He showed me my MRI results and also discussed about my other medical condition and its impact on neural system. I would definitely recommend Dr. Hussain to my friends and family.    	2
Highly recommend. Dr Husssin listened to me, ordered appropriate tests, and I got a diagnosis and plan of treatment very quickly. My experience could not have been any better. Dr. Hussain did more for me in 3 days than 3 other doctors couldn't achieve in many years.	2
He was very kind and listened intently to everything I said. He asked me to elaborate on certain symptoms I was having so he could get a better picture of what the issue was. I was very impressed with him and will continue to see him as my neurologist.	2
Dr. Hussain was very professional.   He was as able to ask detail questions, document my responses and provide answers to my questions.  I felt he wanted to truly understand what I was experiencing.	2
Dr Hussain truly has been very helpful to me and my husband. He answer all my questions with knowledge. He take real interest in my husband  health care.  Pleasantness and courtesy he has given us. Thank you Dr Hussain. 	2
Dr. Hussian is excellent.  From the 1st appt on Dr. Hussain explained everything he was going to do, and everything he did and all the results.  He knew exactly what was going on after the symptons were explained.  Dr. Hussain also followed through with a series of test.  I would refer friends and family to Dr. Hussain.	2
First time patient. Pleasant experience. From appointment scheduling to checkout. I was told to arrive early to complete registration, which if you’ve done that you can definitely be seen at your scheduled time . The doctor met with me first before examination. The process was comfortable and friendly. He was very thorough.We talked about his recommendations before he escorted me to checkout. The staff is warm and friendly . Scheduling follow ups and additional testing was a smooth transition. 	2
Dr. Hussain is a thoughtful, efficient neurologist.  He has a quiet, comforting  way of addressing all my concerns and asks questions to help make sure he has all the information.  He is timely with appointments, no waiting in the office for long periods of time.  He explains results of testing and gives a plan for how I can manage health.  I have seen other neurologists and have never felt as satisfied or informed about my health.  	2
Very positive experience. Dr. Hussain is very knowledgeable and helpful. 	2
"Dr. Hussain is very thorough and his methodical testing provided an unexpected result which is a significant health risk I would otherwise not have known that I had. His ""bedside manner"" is very calm and reassuring.  I am happy I was referred to him and would recommend him without reservation."	2
Dr. Hussain is an excellent Neurologist.  I've been going to him for over 2 years.  He has a complete understanding of my Chronic Migraine condition.  He is kind, considerate and able to see and hear me as a person with pain.  One of the best Neurologist I've every been to.	2
I was referred to Dr. Hussain after experiencing what appeared to be a mini stroke. Dr. Hussain took an ample amount of time questioning me about the episode and did extensive testing to fully diagnose what happened. He really listened and explained everything in detail and in terms that I could understand. I would refer him to any and everyone who needs a genuinely caring, concerned and attentive neurologist.	2
Yes, I would without hesitation.	2
I would not recommend Dr. Hussain Nabeen, due to the unprofessionalism, unorganization, and uncaring way the staff treats patients.  I never had such a chaotic experience in scheduling an appointment in my life.  It took over a month to get an appointment scheduled.  I provided the staff the proper insurance and referral in which they acknowledge & confirmed. I registered online, as they requested.  Then the staff cancelled my appointment the day before without just cause or reason.    	0
Dr. Hussain has been fantastic in helping me deal with my migraines for at least the past three years. He really listens and has worked with me to find the right combination of medicines. This has changed over time, and I never feel like he is forcing a medicine. When I've had a medicine not work, he has always found an alternative, and has also helped make sure I'm on as few as possible. He's efficient, kind, patient and thorough. Can't recommend him highly enough! 	2
I was very nervous because I had this test performed 3 times in the past at different facilities and it was absolutely painful.  However, it was TOTALLY different this time!  Dr. Hussain was very gentle and the entire procedure went very quickly and it was really tolerable.  This was my 4th time and hopefully my last.  If I ever have to have the nerve tests perform again, I'm coming to see Dr. Hussain and his staff.  I did not cry at all. Nor was I in pain when I left.	2
"Dr. Hussain has been wonderful.  With the appropriate testing, Dr. Hussain diagnosed what I had been calling ""sinus headaches"" for years, as migraines.  Taking a conservative approach, he prescribed an older drug that appears to has greatly reduced the frequency of my headaches.

I found him to be thorough, thoughtful and gentle a doctor.  He listened well, asked me good questions & I am extremely happy with the outcome."	2
Dr. Hussain listens to his patients, he observes them diligently to pick up on maladies that are not his specialty. He reviews lab work and other procedures performed for other doctors for contributing factors to the reason  being referred. By doing all of the above, he saved my life. By expressing concern that a doctor had not addressed serious blockages, we sought a second opinion that kept me from a life threatening heart attack by having by-pass surgery. Because he cares, I am alive	2
Dr. Hussain is an Awesome Neurologist. He runs tests to rule out certain conditions and not assume. He is very efficient and I enjoy visiting he always make sure I'm OK and have no doubt's or questions. Keep up the Great work	2
Dr. Hussain has been my doctor since 2005. He stays on top of current medical information to help his patients. I am a very questioning person and he always patiently answers my questions and if I don't ask any he ask me where my list is. If I want to try something he looks it over and tells me if I should or should not try it. If he says no he always tells me his reasons for that decision. I have recommended him to several people over the years. I have not problem getting appointments with Dr. 	2
Dr. Hussain is very professional, personable and puts his patients at ease.  He knows how to talk to patients about their illness, medication and overall health. I would recommend him to anyone who has neurological conditions.	2
Dr Hussain is the greatest! He's efficient & listened to my issues...I have recommemded several patients over the years.	2
Dr. Hussain is exactly what I needed. He was reassuring, and looked at all my information even from studies I had done over ten years ago. He thoroughly researched my medical history and gave me sound advice by walking me through every decision involving my healthcare.	2
I would highly recommend Dr. Hussain to anyone looking for a neurologist.  I sought care for migraines and Dr. Hussain ordered a thorough workup consisting of several tests.  He explained the purpose of each test, and after I had them done he went over each of the results.  I felt like he really listened to my concerns and developed a plan that fit my needs.  He even went above and beyond when I encountered some prescription/insurance issues...I can't recommend Dr. Hussain enough.	2
"I'd like to express my overall experience  as being  well above just generally satisfied with the knowledge and efficiency of Dr. Hussain and his office assistant ( Tannette) .
     As a matter of fact the staff as a whole are very friendly and knowledgeable, especially Tannette because she seems to really go the extra mile with the right words and patience dealing with public .
Thank You ,
Herb Jackson , Jr."	2
"Very pleased with the progress I have made with Dr Hussain. I always recommend him with my friends. Thanks a bunch Dr. Hussain. 
-Junior Ramos"	2
I have been seeing Dr. Hussain for almost a year now and he is the first Dr. in years that has really listened and helped me to find relief for my chronic pain.  I really like his patient calm demeanor when I can no longer deal with the pain.  He is thorough and has helped me more than many others at Johns Hopkins and other institutions. I would highly recommend him to anyone.	2
Dr. Hussain is the most caring and responsive doctor that I have ever had. I went to him when I was first diagnosed with MS. He immediately soothed my nerves and made me feel like we were fighting together to combat the disease. His is a joy to work with and I trust him completely with my care.	2
I just love Dr Hussain. He is a very knowledgeable Neurologist. He keeps up with all the latest medications and technologies. Dr Hussain has been my doctor for over 9 years. When he diagnosed my MS he was so kind. He made sure I was ok and that I understood all my medical options. Dr Hussain has even called me at home to recommend a new and improved medication that was perfect for me. His office is very friendly and they do not overbook their appointments. I would highly recommend Dr Hussain.	2
I was very impressed with Dr Hussain not just with him but the whole staff. He recommended a few tests that were performed onsite. The techs were very professional.  As far a Dr Hussain he was very thorough, explained all the test. I didnt feel like he was pushing me in order to go to the next patient. I trust him with my health care. Would definitely recommend him to others who need his medical specialty.  	2
"
THANK YOU DR. HUSSAIN, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY THE BEST AND I AM SO THANKFUL TO HAVE YOU AS MY DOCTOR. Even though I have to drive 2 hours to see him, it is well worth it. Anyone looking for a REALLY excellent neurologist run, don't walk to see Dr. Nabeen Hussain."	2
I have been taking my husband to Dr. Hussain for the past several years.  He is always professional, kind, knowledgeable and willing to take the time to listen to any concerns we have regarding my husband's medical status.  We can always count on being taken close to our designated appointment time, which is not the case with many physicians.  It is obvious that Dr. Hussain loves his professional and truly cares about his patients.	2
Dr. Hussain has been taking care of me for 10 years keeping me going and alive.  I've got Parkinson and before being treated by Dr. Hussain my health was getting worse and now I've got my life back.  His choice of medications continue to work great.  The practice Neurological Medicine, P.A. is always timely with billing. appointments. and care.  No unnecessary testing and prompt notification of results.  Dr. Hussain is also respectful of your concerns and is always very helpful.  Great Staff.   	2
Great Dr. professional but caring. Listens to every word, and never rushes! 	2
Dr. Hussain expedited my testing as my condition worsened and was able to correctly diagnose my illness and get me started on treatment. The treatment he recommended has me back to a healthy state and normal activity levels.	2
I have seen Dr Hussain for many years.  I have always been very happy with his appointments.  He has always taken time with me and has treated my condition with care and consideration.  He has only scheduled tests we both have determined I needed.	2
I love Dr. Patton! He really knows his stuff! He's kind, compassionate, he listens and is fully engaged. Has great pointers for living with Multiple Sclerosis. Very grateful to have him as my neurologist.	2
My 11 years of seeing thedr. has been consistently the same,  Namely attentive listenener who always trys to resolve any of my issues.  He show concern and empathy    I only wish he had a bag of miraccles.	2
I have saw Dr Patton for 13 years. I wouldn't trust anyone else. Wonderful Dr and staff.	2
Here are feelings after my first visit to see Dr. Patton. He is both a professional and a personable man. I immediately felt comfortable with him. He took time with me while doing various tests including walking down the hall with me and keeping me from walking into the wall. He confirmed my diagnosis of PSP and gave me helpful information about dealing with PSP in the future. I really look forward to my next appointment coming up in August.	2
I've been with Dr. Patton for my father and now myself for 20+ years and have always, always been well heard and expertly treated.  I recommend him to all who need neurological services.  	2
Very Good	2
Dr. Patton is the greatest and the most caring doctor I have ever had, I travel almost (2) hours to receive his care, what a beautiful bedside manner he has..	2
Have been always been a very caring doctor and listens to what we have to say.  I think with as a caregiver this is important for proper treatment and ease of life for his patients.	2
Dr. Patton has been my neurologist now for several years. He's knowledgeable about my disease even though it's extremely rare. He listens to what I have to I have to say. He also responds quickly when I send messages thru their online portal. His staff is also great and have been extremely helpful in dealing with difficult pharmacy issies.	2
Knowledgeable, thorough, personable, engaging - best possible experience for over 5 years as his patient	2
Dr. Patton is a very patient and understanding doctor.  One never feels rushed and feels as though he is the only patient Dr. Patton is seeing that day.  My health has improved tremendously under his care.	2
dr patton and his staff has given me outsta ding care since 2013 when I  found out I had PD.   As a veteran he has worked with VA so i can get the medicine I need and the care I require.   I am very glad to have Dr Patton has my PD Doctor	2
"Dr. Patton treated me for approximately seven years, and I have great respect for him.  He is a skilled doctor with a VERY quick mind.  He is kind.
He is the only Dr. that I have ever looked forward to seeing for an annual exam.
After some tests, he diagnosed my disability.  When I was asked by my employer to get a 2nd opinion regarding my condition, (for work related reasons) the Dr. who gave me the 2nd opinion said to me ""why are you here? You are already seeing Asheville's area expert on your condition""!!  (He was referring to Dr. Patton)
I also benefited from seeing Dr. Patton's PA's.
Payal Soni-Patel was always engaged and attentive, very sharp.
And Rebecca McGowan suggested two additional treatment options in an attempt to help me.  A special muscle cream and physical therapy for my hand condition.
Due to the nature of my disability, I am no longer an required to be under a Dr's care; hence, I no longer need to see Dr. Patton.  I will miss him. He helped me & I am grateful."	2
Dr. James Patton is extremely knowable, warm and set me at ease. I would recommend him with ease.	2
Exceptional physician.  Highly recommend.  	2
Always on time. Listens to all aspects of my health concerns, pleasant easy to talk to  Offered new medication to treat my long standing condition   Calls to the office are responded to quickly and in a reasonable time frame	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Patton's since 2004/2005 and I could not be happier nor more confident in his care. Appointments are always easy and not ever stressful as the office is well managed. I have never had to wait long for my appointment and I have always been accommodated when I have needed to see him.	2
HAS done me in moving me froward in all my care.	1
Dr. Patton has given me excellent care as well as answered all my questions and concerns. When I’m unsure of anything he’s been patient and taken the time to explain to me in ways I can understand.	2
Extremely caring Dr.  Good diagnostician.  Easy to talk with—listens and shows respect.  I have recommended him to several friends who had the same great results!  	2
"Dr. Patton is patient, listens to what you have tho say and ask. He does not rush you. 
He knows about Multiple Sclerosis, what new medicines are coming out and what research is being done."	2
Outstanding care.  Great rapport.  Caring.  Listens. Pleasant, friendly yet very professional.  Outstanding credentials and reputation.	2
He is friendly , attentive and appears to be very knowledgeable.  How could you want more in a physician?	2
Very professional, very thorough in getting to the bottom of the patients issues so he can move forward in helping..	2
Dr.Patton is very personable & spends time answering all of our questions.  	1
"I've always been satisfied with Dr. Patton's care.
"	2
I would definitely recommend Dr. Patton to anyone needing an outstanding neurologist. His staff is a reflection of his professionalism and care.	2
Dr. Patton was so thorough and helpful.	2
GOOD LISTENER, UNDERSTANDS MY NEEDS AND SYMPTOMS, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT RESULTS	2
Dr. Patton wants easy problems with easy answers.  Wouldn't change medication when I told him they wasn't working...	2
Dr.patton is one of the best dr i have ever been to. If you need neurological treatment go to dr Patton.	2
Dr Patton is always punctual, knowledgeable and thorough. He’s up to speed on my condition and what’s going on with me. He is straight forward and kind at the same time.	2
would highly recommend	2
"My husband has Parkinson's and we were referred to Dr Patton by a local PD organization 2 years ago. Dr Patton has a calm ""bedside"" manner who takes ""the scary"" out of dealing with this horrible disease. He is very perceptive of the medicinal needs of my husband in order to keep him somewhat ""balanced"". He responds to any issues/concerns brought up between visits thru the patient portal within hours! What Dr does that today?!!
His entire staff is top notch & the facility whistle clean. I highly recommend Dr Patton!"	2
I highly recommend Dr. Patton. He takes time to listen to his patient, never rushes through a visit, addresses each and all concerns with explanations in layman's terms.  His file documentations are clear, detailed and reflect a true summary of each visit.  	2
Dr. Patton is an excellent diagnostician and, in fact, on my husband's first visit said he did not have Parkinsons as previously diagnosed and over medication was the reason for his falls.  He was correct and there have been no falls since.  Dr. Patton listens carefully to your input and does not dismiss what you report to him.  He is wonderful and I would recommend him in a heartbeat.  And, in fact, I have.	2
Dr. Patton is a sensitive, caring, concerned health care professional.  He listens to your concerns and provides effective treatments.  He is a real human being who wants to help.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Patton since the year 2000.  I could not smile, nor speak correctly.  He began treatment, thus correcting both these problems.  I absolutely adore Dr. Patton.  He is very kind, and gentle.  I highly recommend Dr. Patton to anyone having neurological problems involving  muscles.	2
I've been seeing Dr. Patton for many years with a complicating condition. He has always been a very caring, compassionate and knowledgable physician. He has also always advocated for me when other doctors weren't exactly cooperative. He has been my cheerleader of sorts when things weren't going well and as things improved has been my congratulator. I can't say enough good things about his expertise. He also sees my mother and is an expert in her disease.	2
"Have recommended Dr Patton to several of my friends . He has helped me so much. A Great Doctor.
"	2
"Dr. Patton is a nice and caring listener. However, I typically do not see him. Instead I usually see his PA. In my examination by the PA if I say I want to talk to the doctor he responds. When I started seeing him a few years ago I was surprised to realize this is the care model. I have had several experiences when my phone calls (one very urgent) were not returned or very slow. I have a serious neurological condition and it seems that treatment suggestions are initiated by me. He is the doctor and I want to benefit from his medical insight. 
Perhaps there are not enough neurologists in this area. I feel that I am just one of a huge caseload so care is hurried and streamlined. Frankly, I deserve more aggressive care options.
It is encouraging that he is requesting input on the quality of care. I hope that this criticism leads to changes."	2
I would most definitely  recommend  Dr. Patton to others.	2
Dr Patton has been treating me for several years. From the first time that I  met him he  has had the biggest smile on his face as he greeted me entering my room. He is a very kind, thoughtful, and compassionate physician. He is always  interested in my well being and he is a very knowledgeable physician in neurology. 	2
Always seen on time and with caring associates	2
Excellent diagnostician...as well as very patient-oriented and caring	2
And outstanding physician! His bedside manner is a rare thing to see in medicine today and is valued immensely!	2
He is extremely knowledgeable and personable. I have total confidence in his assessment.	2
"Having spent a lifetime around physicians......this one is special humble and forthright! ...very perceptive and approachable, available  ,amenable to suggesions , and knows his stuff! He and his staff get back to me immediatly,he works really well with my FP......and I Iive out in the middle of Like Michigan,   ...... 
30 miles offshore.....I cannot say enough positive things about this .......angel... in a bow tie!"	2
Dr. Patton is the best. I knew him from my role as a nurse and a care giver. I was blessed to know him professionally then I became a patient. He is superior to most physicians in this region. I would rate him 5+++. He is simply the best.	2
Routine periodic visit	1
Dr. Pahwa is internationally known in movement disorders, and is expert in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease.   His practice at  the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City is located within the Alfred Landon Movement Disorder Clinic.  I experienced a several month wait to see Dr. Pahwa, but after seeing him the first time it is apparent why.   I feel so fortunate to now be counted at a regular patient.  He and his staff could practice in any city,  and I am so blessed they choseKC	2
Good Doctor treating my Parkinson. Answer v all questions	2
The office staff were very friendly, but the students gathering information in the exam rooms had no bedside manner whatsoever. After waiting about six months to see the doctor, I would expect a better experience. After nearly an hour wait, Dr. Pahwa arrived and was cordial. I was hopeful that our experience would be more positive. He does not sugar-coat his observations and gives his opinion without editing. We left a bit down when we could have received the same info. w/ a more positive spin.	0
DR PAHWA INSTRUCTED MY DEEP BRAIN SURGERY TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BRAIN AND PREDICTED THAT MY PARKINSON WOULD SOON MOVE TO THE LEFT SIDE  OF MY BODY. SO FAR(1 YR PLUS) IT HASNT.  I FEEL THAT THE DBS HAS DONE WONDERS FOR MY PARKINSONS AND I ALSO HAVE ADDED REGENERATIVE MEDICINE (STEM CELL) WHICH I FEEL IS DOING WONDERS FOR MY PARKINSONS.  DR MARK WEISS AT K-STATE RESEARCH HAS ADVISED THAT DR PAHWA IS THE BEST THERE IS AND I AM A BELIEVER. I BELIEVE IM ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF TODAYS TECHNOLOGY. 	1
I have been seeing Dr. Oomen for about 5 years. I could tell on my very first visit that he was a awesome Dr. he asked me questions, got information about my epilepsy since it started. He has totally changed my life for the better. I’m so grateful I was referred to this man. He has a special place in my heart.	2
Dr. Oommen is the best doctor for treating my epilepsy from cat scratch disease. I hadn't had a good neurologist for that difficulty until I moved here from Illinois five years ago.  He has given me hope and encouragement since I started seeing him.	2
Dr oommen is a great doc if it wasn't for him being kind and understanding of my problems I don't think I would have ever been helped and anyone looking for a dr that truly cares well stop here I'm telling you he is one of the best dr iv had so hey doctor oommen thank you I'll never be able to thank you enough Wallace 	2
Very specific in his treatment.  He goes back from childbirth to your current age to specify what caused your problems and best treatment of your problem. If he thinks surgery or other treatments are best he'll run the week long EEG and let you know. 	2
"Dr Mathews is the best doctor our family has ever seen.  My daughter has epilepsy and another rare type of optic nerve damage, and dr. Mathews has always reached out to others doctors caring for my daughter to help figure out the causes. 
His genuine caring is unique in this field and we are so grateful for his support!"	2
Dr Mathews is friendly and easy to communicate with. He is very knowledgeable and takes time to talk to patients about their problems. I have a number of good physicians that provide medical services to me and Dr. Mathews is one of the very best.	2
Dr. Mathews has been helping my elderly mother with seizures for the last couple of years.  He has always been fantastic.  He takes the time to talk to you -- not rush you -- listens and earnestly tries to properly evaluate the issues at hand.  He is compassionate and caring.  Available to talk if there's an emergency, too.  I wish this man was a general practitioner and I could see him for everything.  I wish all doctors were like Dr. Mathews.  I am very thankful for finding him.	2
I have had various neurologists for the past 30 years. No neurologist, but Dr. Mathews, has been as professional, knowledgeable compassionate and accessible via the portal or in scheuling appointments like him.  He has spent his time generouslyt to discuss what my options are and to explain his recommendations clearly.   He is truly a gifted doctor. 	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Calabresi since 2005. I have recommended him as a doctor to everyone I know that has Multiple Sclerosis. Dr. Calabresi has been extremely helpful in managing my MS and teaching me the best ways to live with the illness.	2
Dr. Kister is an experienced, empathic brilliant neurologist. His ability to assess symptoms and their combined effects on one’s life is impressive and speaks to his knowledge of often vague but profound symptoms as they affect someone’s life. 	2
Dr Kister  and his office failed me miserably. He misdiagnosed me with multiple sclerosis in 2011.   He refused to do a spinal tap but had no problem treating me with toxic medication.  I then begged for  a spinal tap. I contacted his office even the office social worker and got no response at all.  I then received a package from the office with all my records.  I do not have multiple sclerosis.  I have chronic Lyme's disease.  I found out because I doctor did a spinal tap on me and tested me . 	0
Dr. Kister is an amazing professional that know so much about MS.  I feel very confident that he will help me to find the balance I need to control my MS	2
Been with him about 10 years now and I think he great 	2
Dr Lea has always and continues to work with me to best manage my neurological issues I constantly deal with daily.   I know she is simply a phone call away in event of issues that may come up due to my multiple medical conditions.   I trust her judgment and she is very thorough at each visit with me.   I can't say enough good things about her without writing a very long essay.   I hope she is at ochsner for several years to come....thank you Dr Lea.  You're the best.   10 stars!!!!	2
Dr. Lea is an awesome Doctor!  I take my mom to her & she really helped with her medication & her overall health.  I would highly recommend her 5 stars! 	2
Dr. Lea is committed, honest and extremely thorough and smart. My husband and I both liked her even though the diagnosis was not what was hoped for.	2
It took months to get an appointment. At my last appointment, 3rd visit,  I had a list of questions/concerns. She told me we would not be able to get through all of my questions in 20 minutes. When she felt the appointment was over she got up and walked out. She did not say good-bye, summarize the appointment, or discuss the next steps/plan of action. A staff person came in and discussed the next steps. I did not feel like she cared or was concerned about my health issues. I felt like a number. 	0
"Dr. Simnad is much more than a neurologist.  I have shared with her, she seems to not only act as my neurologist, but my pcp, my naturopath, my counselor and my cheerleader!  When needing medical advice and support at such a critical time and sensitive matter, I've always felt so supported and cared for.  Her medical knowledge is extensive and shares through your one-on-one office visit while not rushing your time.  You actually feel valued.  With her direction, my healthcare is manageable and continuingly improving.  
A+ healthcare service!"	2
Dr. Simnad is a good listener.  She has turned Rx renewals and prior authorizations from a nightmare (at my old neurologists) into a smooth running efficient process.  She has taken the stress out of going to the neurologist, or needing something from the neurologists office.  Kudos!!	2
Dr Simnad was very compassionate and also professional. All in the best possible amounts possible.  She is also very gentle in her approach both physically and verbally. I would highly recommend her to    anyone experiencing ms symptoms.	2
Dr. Simnad never rushes me and always does a thorough exam.  She answers all my questions and never leaves me hanging.  I love her and her office!	2
"Awful! Once test results were in she suggested that my daughter was ""drug seeking"" and needed a therapist. We have a tremendous amount of neurological family history, from strokes, brain aneurysm, and MS. She obviously wasn't willing to look further to find a diagnosis. No patient should walk out of an office looking for answers that result in ""crazy"" or drug addiction accusations. Shame on YOU!"	0
She is a very good doctor and I don't mind driving up to West Burlington to see her. It is easier to get appointments with her than at UIowa which is a longer drive. She was trained at UIowa so I am sure her standard is their standard. Cant say the same about her staff though. They are the worst I have encountered and do not reflect the good Iowan values that is expected of them. She should fire her team and hire new ones. 5 stars for the Doc, 0 Stars for her staff.	2
"HORRIBLE!  I would rate this doctor and her staff a ZERO! 
I have been to many doctors and have NEVER experienced anything like this in my life!
This dr. does not want to spend more than 3 minutes with you - even after an MRI.  Trying to get answers is like pulling teeth.  Most of the medical staff on the phone are downright rude!  Today was the last straw! After 2 calls, I waited 4 days and FINALLY got a phone call that lasted 21 SECONDS from a rude nurse. I'm DONE! 
Do NOT waste your money! "	0
I like her very much.  I feel like I am in good hands when she treats me. - Molly	2
she is a very good doctor and her knowledge of the medical field is second to none. I have made many visits to her office from before she joined the practice and I like her approach to treating patients. The wait times however are getting higher lately, which is an inconvenience. 	2
I highly recommend Dr. Spriah Pavuluri. She is a very compassionate doctor who gives the time one would expect to explain your problems to her. She is very busy as there are not many neurologists in Southeast Iowa so there is a long wait for an appointment with her, but she is worth the wait.	2
I was referred to Dr. Pavuluri, MD by SSDI for exam for disability. She refused to continue the exam because I was too sick (to weak) to complete the exam. How can someone be too sick for disability??? Completely disappointed in her ability.	0
"Very knowledgeable.
Very friendly.
Listens to your concerns.
Answers all your questions.

Best doctor ive been to.	2
I visited her at the Burlington office. She is very understanding and works with you to find the best possible way to address the issues. I have an injury from long time ago which has changed my life for ever. Nothing can change it or make it go away but having her treat me and guide me makes me feel properly cared for and prevents further damage and deterioration I feel. Her staff are very polite too and make sure you are wasting no time during your visits.	2
I just love Dr. Spriha Pavuluri. She has treated me and 2 other of my family members. She treats everyone with the utmost respect and dignity and makes you feel comfortable during the visit.	2
"I had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Spriha Pavuluri. She is clearly one of the best doctors I visited. She spends time with you during each appointment and does not rush you.
A very charming person with a lovely smile."	2
"Dr. Pavuluri is very knowledgeable and is assuring with her patients. Her confidence makes you feel like you are in safe and good hands. She follows up with her patients and make sure you understand what steps need to be taken or what to do next and she never gives up on you. In one word, she is very passionate with her work. I will recommend her to friends and family.

Excellent experience,  Extremely thorough. . Explained things in a way that we could easily understand. Allowed time for us to ask questions and express our concerns. Put together an action plan starting me on medication to prevent nocturnal seizures. Ordered an MRI to gather more data than what the EEG showed.. Very compassionate.	2
The office staff in Dr. Do's office are always courteous , friendly and helpful.  They are always eager to answer questions I have.  I don't feel rushed to ask for information about a health problem.	2
"Entire staff is very friendly and professional
 One could not ask for a more pleasant atmosphere to visit"	2
Very nice and caring doctor	2
I’m extremely happy with my experience with Dr. Do. He really take his time with me and took his time to listen to what I had to say. I don’t have nothing negative to said i really love it ?? and the team that work with him really great. 	2
Staff is very friendly and caring.	2
Awesome Doctor . Very knowledgeable, polite, compassionate & takes time to listen. 	2

Dr. Do is one of the best physicians I have had as a doctor.  He is professional and thorough in all procedures.  I would recommend Dr. Do to any patient needing care.  His staff is awesome and the team shows much compassion.	2
"
I find him very knowledge with a great way of communicating with patients on a level they can understand what is going on. He always treats you as if you are his only patient, like he cares."	2
I have never had to wait to be seen.  His office is excellent at getting me in a room to be seen by Dr. Do at my appointment time.  And there isn't the usual long wait inside the patient room before you are seen.  As soon as I am led to a room and the nurse follows me right in, gets your vitals, then asks why you are there.  She leaves room and gives the information to Dr. Do who then comes right in or within a couple of minutes.  Sometimes he comes into room before the nurse has even finished,	2
Dr. Do showed that he cared about my symptoms. He explained, in detail, diagnostic procedures.	2
Living in Orange Park is very convenient for me to get to the office without heavy traffic. Can always get an appointment. The staff and doctor always have pleasant attitudes. Very short wait times in the office. 	2
Dr. Do is a very thorough and  knowledgeable doctor. We have the utmost respect for he and his practice. He treats everyone with the most respect and it is a pleasure to know him.	2
"I cannot say enough regarding Dr. Do.  He is pleasant and caring and really is knowledgeable about my condition.  I would strongly recommend him to anyone who has a neurological problem and cannot find answers.  He is on the top of my list for knowing what I need and how to accomplish goals toward a wonderful life ahead of me - instead of the usual news you obtain from doctors who say ""deal with it"" -- his Assistant Devahn, is a delight as well.  I cannot say enough about them.!"	2
I would like to thank you Dr Do. I don't know what I would be doing right now if I had not knew what is causing my dizziness. It has been 27 years of going through several Doctors and no one said anything about what I Know now.	2
Dr. Do took the time to explain my condition to me and my family. His medical assistant was so friendly and we felt so welcome. A great doctor and a friendly office. 	2
Dr.Do is an amazing dr. he goes over every lil thing and tells you exactly whats going on and how to handle it. i am calling in the morning to make appt with him on my neck and lower back. he is already my neurologist on the  mass i have on my brain. i couldnt ask for a better person in my care. 	2
Dr. Do explains all the test and everything that you need to here about what is going on with your healthcare.	1

regarding one's conditions. I will definitely recommend Dr. Do for treatment."	2

Dr. Pantelyat is the fourth neurologist I have engaged. I am happy to recommend him.	2
"Dr. Pantelyat was able to finally make the diagnosis and more importantly able to regulate my prescriptions  to improve my quality of life. 
He is extremely knowledgeable and will spend as much time with you as needed."	2
An amazing Doctor! Very thorough and patient! Would highly recommend!  	2
He is brilliant and compassionate.	2
Dr. Matarese treats my Epilepsy, Migraines and my son's Tourette's, he is caring, kind, compassionate and very through. I highly recommend him.	2
Great doctor. Very personable and witty!	2
"We first met Dr. Matarese after my daughter had a head injury while playing soccer.   He was very thorough, patient and diagnosed her with a concussion.  He prescribed a long term plan for her school and her therapy with good results.  My daughter felt very comfortable with him.  
We now take my mother to him as well for dementia.  My mom thinks he is very nice.  He has such a gentle and caring bedside manner and never rushes through an exam.  I would recommend his practice

"	2
Dr. Matarese was extremely thorough, patient, and kind. He took the time to listen and explain. Based on my visit, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his practice for anyone I know, who might need a neurologist.	2
Great dr great person	2
When my mother was diagnosed with dementia we saw him. He met us one time and recommended us to Capital Health Neurologist.  Unfortunately Capital Health Neurologist moved and Dr. Matarese's office contacted us to schedule appt. We went and they were unsure why we were there(even though they called us to schedule). He was once again dismissive telling us that there is nothing he can do other than prescribe medication and he will see us in a year.  	0
Arrogant. Nasty. Rude. Condescending    Refused to listen.  Only wanted to TELL.    and after another consult he was WRONG. 	0
In 40+ years of dealing with doctors, I have never experienced such amazing care. My son was injured in a ski accident and we tried desperately to see a neurologist. Everyone was booked solid, including Dr. Matarese. But Dr. Matarese gave us the SAME DAY appointment. It was at 5:30 pm, after his office closed. He stayed with us for 2 hours, examining every XRay and CT scan. He diagnosed a concussion and evaluated things that were even unrelated to neurology, like my son's back pain from the acci	2
From the time you enter the door, you’re greeted with care, compassion and they’re very helpful. Then Charlene, (Dr. Selley Medical Assistant) she is amazing and sweet as can be!!! She goes out of her way to help. She cares about each patient and treats them like they matter. With Dr. Seeley, he is #1 Neurologist.  He’s very intelligent and will also look outside the box in trying to get to the bottom of things. He listens and interacts with the patient and family on ideals and resolutions. Absolutely awesome with best bedside manner and sense of humor. Grateful to y’all. God Bless Y’all Always.	2
I have been a patient of Dr. Seeley for several years. I find him kind, attentive, and knowledgeable about my seizures and their treatment. I have been seizure-free for ten years after the right combination of medications, and the implantation of a Vagus Nerve Stimulator. He always takes the time to listen and to explain things if I need it. He monitors the side effects of my meds and of the VNS. He's a very cheerful and personable, but always professional, man. 	2
Great staff, very responsive,  never really wait for an appointment.  Dr Seeley is very attentive and gives me good direction on my stoke.	2
Dr. Seeley understands and supports my neurological needs.  He is able to work with other doctors, is flexible with medications so they are tailored to me, and can answer my questions.	2
"I am a new patient to Dr. Seeley. I was impressed with the office staff and how professional they were, especially Charlene who was extremely kind and knowledgeable. Dr. Seeley took time to talk about my past medical history. He was very thorough. I felt like he was genuinely concerned about me and the issues I was having with Neurogenic Cardiac syncope.
Today, I had two tests ordered by Dr. Seeley at Menorah Medical Center. The technician administering the test told me that Dr. Seeley stopped by the Neurology lab to see how my testing was going. I was very impressed by that.
I feel fortunate to have Dr. Seeley caring for me and if I ever had to recommend a Neurologist to anyone, I would certainly recommend Dr. Seeley.

Kimberly Loveland McHardie"	2
"I would recommend anyone to Dr. Seeley and his staff. I'm 60 years old and have never had a doctors office make me feel so comfortable and caring. In the last year, I gone through some really hard times in the last year.  Dr. Seeley and his staff have been there 100% of the time.
Take time to sit down with Dr. Seeley. You will hear the care in his voice and see the comfort in his eyes. 
"	2
Nice, professional. Gives adequate amount of time. Friendly. I recommend Dr. Seeley.	2
Dr. Seeley is a compassionate Dr and he gives his patients as much as they need to ask ask the questions they have. He is not in a hurry to move on to the next patient. He is very thorough and has helped me get my epilepsy under control with the least amount of meds and ones with little to no side affects. I highly recommend Dr Seeley.	2
Dr. Seeley always spends so much time listening to me. I always appreciate it. His medical assistant always calls me back quickly, and the people at check in, and check out are very nice. A friend recommended me to Dr. Seeley as well. I definitely would recommend visiting him and his office. 	2
Good Doctor!	2
Dr. Seeley is very knowledgeable and has a really genuine kindness with his patients.  We're very grateful for his expertise and caring!	2
Dr Seeley is very good at what he does!  He is very easy to talk with about the situations and experiences of your problem.    He CARES!	2
Dr. Seeley is an incredibly competent doctor.  He is kind, patient and will give you the straight information on your condition in a positive, non threatening manner.  Dr. Seeley does not jump to the worse case senario and fill you up with unnecessary drugs or expensive tests.  He knows his business and sincerely cares about his patience.  Dr. Seeley also surrounds himself with a great staff who are a reflection of his standards.  I would recommend Dr. Seeley to anyone needing a great doctor.	2
Dr. Seeley is a good listener and fully answers my questions.  His explanations are clear.  He is patient, positive, steady.  I have full confidence in him. 	2
Dr. Seeley and his staff are always very professional and answer all my questions quickly when I call and leave a message.  Always willing to work with me on my granddaughters medications. Would recommend him to all!!	2
I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Seles and the staff at Johnson County Neurology.  When you come in you are immediately greeted.  The front desk is helpful, professional, and genuinely caring.  The person who checks you into the room is likewise personable and friendly.  I Aldo found Dr. See let to be very knowledgeable and one who truly listens to your concerns. He is in no way condescending.  I highly recommend this dr and practice!	2
I had seen other neurologistswho specializes in epilepsy and Dr. Seeley is the only one who had more experience in post traumatic seizures and PTE. Dr. Seeley has been able to find medicine with less side effects at the same time bring better control over my seizure activity. I highly recommend him.	2
Dr. See my is an excellent neurologist.  He does a thorough examination,answering any questions and always checking to make sure there are no interpretations between medications before writing a new prescription.  He has an excellent bedside manner and a sense of humor that makes you feel comfortable.  Originally. My primary physician had referred me to another neurologist but he didn't have any openings so they gave.me an. appointment with Dr Seely.  I would recommend him to any family members 	2
He is a great doctor! Takes the time to make sure you have all your questions answered and have the right treatment! 	2
I wish all the Doctors I see were and friendly and interested as Dr. Seely.	2
Dr. Seeley was so patient and kind to my mom, who has Dementia.  He allowed me to ask questions and gave me detailed answers. We didn't have to wait for him more than 5 minutes in the exam room.  I would recommend Dr. Seeley to anyone that needs a Neurologist.	2
"I have been suffering with uncontrolled epilepsy since age 15 now i am 55 and nothing changed. Trying every drug on the market. After talking with dr. Seley he really understood my problems and we tried several drugs, testing and found a drug that will work. 
He understands and is a fantastic physician,.....
Paul"	2
My husband has MS, and we have been seeing Dr.Seeley since 2013.  He is a very caring doctor who takes time to listen to us and our concerns.  I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a neurologist.	2
Dr. Seeley takes real personal time with us, never seems rushed, is attentive and thoughtful as he makes whatever recommendations.  	2
"Dr. Seeley is an amazing doctor. You can tell him anything about yourself and he doesn't judge you. He is very personal with his patients and what I mean by that is you are not a number to him. He remembers everything about me. Example: So how is your nursing school going for you? last time you saw me you said your dog was sick.... is you dog any better? 


He is also very...
1. attentive
2. forward thinking
3. empathetic 
4. industrialist

HE CARES!!!!"	2
"UNRESPONSIVE TO REQUEST FOR FOLLOW-UP TESTS AND PATIENT CONTACT.

LAST CONTACT WAS NOV. 2015. REPEATED CALLS  (LEFT URGENT MESSAGES IN DECEMBER 2015 AND JANUARY 2016) AFTER HE WAS BACK FROM VACATION BUT NO RETURN CALLS FROM STAFF OR DOCTOR CARUNCHIO. VERY, VERY FRUSTRATED!!!"	0
Dr. Samanta is a Miracle Worker. He is treating me for severe hemifacial spasm that I have suffered with for 13 years. I am now symptom free with beautiful results. I was treated by several other neurologists in the past and not one of them was able to achieve the symptom-free results the Dr Samanta has. I can't recommend him more highly. 	2
Very Thorough, professional , honest, and accurate based on data and research and best practices.  If you want the truth with compassion about your condition, you will want to work with Dr. Forchetti.	2
"She is wonderful! We are grateful we have her as our doctor.
Caring and explains all details that we understand.
"	2
Dr. R has been my Dr. For 43 years, and He is the best!! His nurse, Wanda is the worst he has ever had!! Even my pharmacy is complaining, about calls and fax's  not answered  , and hateful attitude. I shouldn't have to look for a new Dr, because of an unprofessional,  rude, inconsiderate nurse,  but looks like thats what I will have to do after all these years. No way to talk to Dr. Richardson Anymore, shame! Surely there are plenty of good nurses needing a job!!	2
Dr Richardson is the best Dr ive ever had.  nurse can be hard to deal with, but Dr rocks!!!!!!!	2
"I would NOT recommend Dr. Spears under ANY condition.  He did gallbladder surgery on me in

Dr . Spears is a absolutely great doctor, and wonderful surgeon.  He treated me with respect, and he really cared about the patient. Thanks Dr. Spears for all that you have helped me . ??	2
I went there a few weeks ago for the first time.  Dr. Wascomb and his staff are very polite and very professional. No waiting. He took his time and on my way out I had my medicine. Super convenient. Even though I have ins. I paid a small amount out of pocket  and submitted my visit. The following day I received a phone call to see how I was doing. I don't think I will go anywhere else in the future. Thank you!	2
My daughter was having an allergic reaction, and luckily this awesome clinic was close by. Dr. Wascomb saw her immediately and saved her life! He is now our primary care doctor. Highly recommend. 	2
Dr. Wascomb is the most respectful, uplifting, and efficient doctor I have ever visited. His new clinic out in Oak Grove is just lovely, and convenient too! He and his staff greet you with a smile and truly care about patients. Incredible customer service and holistic care. Thank you Dr. Wascomb!	2
"Dr. Shorter is THE BEST Dr. in this world. She is extremely knowledgeable, cares about her patiemts, and will spend all the time it takes to answer your questions. Her professionalism is absolutely amazing.  
If you want first class health care and awesome patient (customer) service, she is top shelf!!! "	2
I have been seeing Dr. Shorter for a year, and I have been so happy with her office. She’s always been thorough and never makes me feel like she is rushing through the appointment. When she switched me to a new medication, she answered all my questions and even made me aware of all the things I should know to look out for that could be problematic while on the medication. Her nurse is also extremely nice, and I’ve always had pleasant interactions with the rest of her staff. 	2
Dr. Shorter is so personable and knowledgable and takes the time to really talk with you!	2
I used to go to Dr. Shorter a few years ago and realized she was not ready for the responsibility.  She didn't read her charts,  she always had one hand on the doorknob like she was ready to bolt the second you stopped talking and she's not a good listener.  She doesn't call to give you the results of your tests and at the time she was not affiliated with any hospitals. 	0
I have been going to this practice for about a year now and am very disappointed.  I had a MRI and the results were never read and Dr never contacted me I had to see another Dr to find out I had an issue and needed medication and possible surgery!	0
Very patient and sincere doctor. I am glad I could find him. He reviews lab reports thoroughly  and takes immediate follow up steps. 	2
Dr Reyes is a very compassionate and thorough physician.  I have been seeing him for many years I would recommend him to anybody needing a kind and well-knowledge physician. 	2
One of the most caring and compassionate Doctors by far. Dr Reyes took his time and listened to my concerns. He was not quick to give me prescriptions and shuffle me out the door. He agreed with me as to how we need to find out a proper diagnosis and treat accordingly, not just mask my symptoms. Thank you so much Dr Reyes and staff!	2
"Very caring and understanding doctor ....listen to you and gives his honest treatment options. Very health conscious and loves sending you to evermans ...lol 

"	2
Love Dr. Bob! He is like a family friend! Great man and doctor. 	2
New to the area and have a lot of health concerns. Dr. Adams is the best, he listens and takes time with you. Runs the tests needed and tries to help you make better life choices before just throwing a bunch of meds your way. Office staff is great, no issues getting appointments or waiting in the office forever. I highly recommend Dr. Adams to anyone.	2
I switched doctors because I got tired of having a scheduled appointment and waiting 3 hours past appointment time. Then doctor took 10 minutes with me, long enough to hear my first and last sentence. There is no telephone service. Ridiculous. Dr Adams: my knight to rescue.A doctor that memorizes all you say, recognizes you on future visits and is familiar with your medical history. His staff-the best. If I have needed urgent apt-no problem. He is fantastic. Try him- you’ll like him!! Super Dr!!	2
Dr Adams is the best family doctor I have ever been to . Everyone in the office is like family. Great doctor. I recommend him to anyone looking for family doctor.	2
Clean office staff is family members, seems to constantly want you for different tests, had pre existing conditions, didn't look at previous history and every time I need refills for prescriptions I have to call every time??? Basically just wants your money , refers anything that isn't basic, and isn't genuine. I won't be back!	0
Dr Merigian is an incredible, intelligent, friendly, physician.  He practices outside of the box, and treats each patient as an individual, not using some protocol treatment for every person.  He tries to find the cause of your illness, and treat that, rather than just mask your symptoms.  He practices both traditional medicine and alternative medicine.  Dr Merigian has helped our family, when more than 45 other physicians and specialists couldn’t.  We love our Doc!	2
"If the Doc did not have a cancellation 12/2016, I probably would be deathly ill or dead. Two weeks prior my appointment, my blood work was in and I was told I had RMSF. Started doxy asap. At appointment time there were many other things that my body was low in. Not to mention borderline diabetic. 
What was my prior doctor of 28 years doing to me!!!  Writing scripts without proper diagnosing. 
This is 14 months later and doing great. 
"	2
He's misdiagnosed my mother several times, the worst being the same day she went to the ER for the problem she was seeing him about.  He'll listen if you can get through to him in an emergency -- one that could have been avoided -- but to get through any other time even at his office you have to get through his head nurse who is not only vindictive but lies about returning urgent calls and important test results. AVOID! 	0
"Thoughtful, informative!!!!!!
Answers and inquisitive question you may have.
A gift connecting with you as an individual not a billing prospective.
She has what MANY doctor are missing in today’s health care compassion .... that has be my experience with her as of meeting on September 2018. 
Thank you!!!!"	2
Excellent! So warm and caring and ready with a plan. 	2
The visit went very well. We discussed short term and long term ways to control joints pain and more general health problems while taking Anastrozol. I am looking forward to my next appointment in September.	2
I met Dr. Adams January 2019, after being diagnosed with cancer. She had been highly recommended by another oncologist. I have been more than pleased with her knowledge on the subject, her professionalism, and her kindness. I always look forward to my next visit with her to discuss the progress and the next steps. She is so thorough in explaining them, to make sure the patient understands. I would recommend her to any member in my family.	2
Very compassionate and listens to patients about options.	2
Dr Adams has been my physician for the past 5 years. Upon first meeting her I knew that she was perfect for me...I was one of the scariest times of my life and she made me feel safe. She is thorough, communicative and kind...she listens which is so important for a physician. 	2
"Dr. Adams is a very professional and caring Doctor.
I have been a patient of hers for five years and every time I see her, I am assured that I am getting the best care."	2
I have been under Dr. Adams' care for five years this coming January 2019.  Her demeanor, patience, knowledge has put me at ease when visiting with her.  	2
Dr. Adams became my oncologist after my original oncologist, who I adored and received the best medical care and an incredible bedside manner, retired from the practice.  Dr. Adams filled his shoes and immediately upon transitioning to fill his spot, was welcoming, engaging and reviewed my history  and overall, evaluated of my progress (which btw, is stellar).  She has a superb supporting team and her interactions are comforting, relaxing and not alarming.    	2
Horrible doctor. Does not listen. Cannot ascertain if you need chemo. Will order a ton of unnecessary tests which will eat up your time and cause unnecessary fear. And many are unproven like an MRI for screening. And will bully you into them. Go anywhere else!!!!!	0
Dr. Adams is wonderful. In addition to her professional expertise she is very warm and personal. I always felt to be in the best possible care and I highly recommend her. 	2
Dr. Adams is one of my favorite doctors. She listens to your concerns patiently, answers all your questions and always greets you with a smile. Her empathy is her most remarkable trait. I feel I am in very good hands and trust her totally. 	2
I highly recommend Dr. Adams and her team.  She is exceptionally knowledgeable with excellent diagnostic skills.  Along with that, she and her team understand and provide empathetic, as well as, practical support.  I feel that I am alive today because of the care I am receiving and greatly appreciate Dr Adams keeping up to date on the the latest treatments available to metastatic breast cancer patients.  She consults with me and helps me understand my options.  I am very confident with this team	2
I am so thankful for Dr. Adams. She is always compassionate and carries a positive energy. When there are bumps in the road, as often occurs with cancers, Dr. Adams is attentive, refers when needed, and remains realistic and optimistic. Most importantly to me, Dr. Adams treats patients as a whole person, carefully weighing all treatment decisions. I'm very fortunate to have her as my oncologist. 	2
"Dr Adams is a kind and knowledgeable breast oncologist. She is willing to try new treatments and evaluate the results on how best to proceed further. I love watching her scan her thoughts and making decisions. So smart!

Her Physicians Assistants Peggy and Anna are very thorough in recording and reviewing your health vitals, symptoms and concerns. They are also compassionate and sweet and so helpful by suggesting medications and ways to help alleviate troublesome chemo symptoms. 

Thankful."	2
I would always recommend Dr. Adams.  A year ago I started my cancer treatment and Dr. Adams and her colleagues were like friends through the journey.  She and they cared and the smile on their faces helped through all the challenges and the difficult times.  One year on and a good prognosis I am so happy that we entrusted my journey and treatment to her.  The treatment seems to have worked but she made the journey a lot easier in so many ways. Thank you!	2
As a breast cancer patient, I am grateful to be under Dr. Sylvia Adams' care.  Dr. Adams is professional, compassionate and understanding. 	2
An important factor in my care from day one of my diagnosis was finding an oncologist and care team who would  treat me as a whole person not just the part of me that had cancer. Dr. Adams became my oncologist after my original care team left NYU. Langone. She created a seamless transition and over the years, Dr. Adams has provided me support that has gone beyond just clinical care. She is a good listener, is supportive of my emotional and physical concerns, and I trust her judgement in my care.	2
Dr. Adams is one of the most intelligent and competent medical professionals I've encountered.  When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, she was forthright, informative and kind.  She took time to thoroughly explain my condition, my treatment options and my chances for survival.  Though not easy conversations, her experience combined with a caring, positive spirit put me at ease and helped me focus on getting well.  I believe the care I received was second to none.	2
Dr Adams has been my onocologist for 3 years during this time she's been consistently attentive, responsive, and adept at referrals when needed. Her staff is excellent and most of all she really cares. She listens to your concerns and addresses them immediately. She responds promptly to your emails and calls. Always with a smiling pleasant disposition. She strives for excellence in the staff and services provided.	2
Dr. Adam is an excellent doctor who takes care very well for every patient. She is very patient and responsible. I remembered that one time I needed to see another doctor then I can continue my second chemo treatment with Dr. Adam. She helps us to make an earliest appointment to see that doctor so that I can have my second chemo on time. Every circles her team and she takes care of me. She is such a beautiful doctor. I trust them and really appreciate them! Highly recommend!	2
Dr. Adams came highly recommended from an oncologist at Sloan Kettering and City of Hope in California.  I met her during my darkest time, stage IV TN breast cancer.  Her professionalism, knowledge, compassion, and willingness to answer any question, and tackle any obstacle made the decision to travel weekly for treatments easier.  I would highly recommend her and her team to anyone faced with breast cancer.	2
Dr Adams is a wonderful physician.  She is very passionate about her patients, is never rushed and always available.  With doctor Adams and her staff as your caregivers you will have a wonderful experience.	2
It feels like I have known Dr. Adams forever. With a cancer diagnosis, she is the one you need in your corner. Her warm smile instantly put you at ease and you immediately feel like you are her only patient. Your care is never RUSHED because she treats the holistic not just the disease. Dr. Adams encourages you to bring along family members to each appointment/ treatment for support and added comfort because her firm belief is that family is an integral aspect of the healing process. She ROCKS!	2
I'm Dr. Adams' patient since 2016 and I feel very lucky that she accepted me for the trial she is running for TPN breast cancer. Dr. Adams is very knowledgeable oncologist with up-to-date research information and open mind.There is saying “What consumes your mind, consumes your life’ and Dr. Adams makes sure that patients’ mind is in optimistic mode.  Dr. Adams responds to all questions promptly, because she cares. Her team is great. I’m thanking GOD for putting this doctor on my way to healing.	2
Within a few minutes, Dr. Adams had suspicions of male breast cancer.  From there, she scheduled and expedited all appointments with the surgeon, geneticist, and the sonogram/mammogram team. After my surgery, she took the time to fully explain the post-operative report and thoroughly explained how chemo and medication would be the best treatment for the future.  Her commitment to me probably saved my life.  If ever put thru the rigors of cancer, she is the person you want by your side!!!	2
I have advanced stage metastatic cancer and I am deeply grateful to be in the care of Dr. Adams, an excellent oncologist.  Dr. Adams is knowledgable, helpful, thoughtful and caring.  During each visit she and her nurse practitioners spend a lot of time with me, sharing information and answering all my questions honestly.  I often have many questions and I feel Dr. Adams listens and hears my questions.  She cares about my health and works hard to see that I receive the best treatments available.	2
"I have been introduce to doctor Adams since 2 years now, and even if I moved out to Florida I don't want to change of MD. 
She is very good at what she is doing, she always offer the last treatment meaning she is very up to date with the ultimate treatment, in addition of her knowledge she is the more caring MD I have ever have, Always very warm and deeply aware of your own situation . 
I would deeply recommend her to anyone been in my case with a stage 4 cancer. "	2
I was terrified,diagnosed w/triple negative breast cancer at 35 but Dr.Adams ignited a feeling of hope in me that I’ve held onto ever since. She's up to date with the latest research & takes great care in determining treatment.Dr.Adams advocated for me & also gave a great pep talk or hug when I needed it. I’m so thankful for her & her team.They got me through one of the most difficult times in my life. The level of care I received made such a difference in my outlook. I will be forever grateful.	2
Takes time with patients.  Addresses questions and concerns promptly and clearly. Thorough overview of all treatment options.  Recommendations that are most up-to-date with current standard of care.  	2
"Dr Adams is a most warm caring doctor. From the moment I met her I knew I was in the best care.
She always smiles, takes her time. And is great in explaining the medical procedures. And so is her nurse Marylyn Johnson.  After all the appointments I feel she is family.
"	2
I feel so fortunate that my cancer surgeon suggested that I select Dr. Adams as my chemo oncologist. I am allergic to so many things, and have so many sensitivities that my case was far from typical (you name a side effect and I had it). Dr. Adams and her staff were always available for my needs, knowledgable, patient, kind, and respectful. No one wants to need an oncologist, but if you find yourself in this unfortunate position, I cannot recommend Dr. Adams highly enough, without reservation!	2
As a very young woman with the surprising diagnosis of breast cancer, I couldn't be happier with Dr. Adams and her support team.  Dr. Adams had the unfortunate responsibility of telling me that I needed to undergo chemo, the thing I was most afraid of, and she did it with compassion and understanding.  She's warm, intelligent, funny, and clearly cares about the well being of all of her patients. I'm happy to have her, and her entire team in my corner while I go through super weird journey.	2
I give Dr Adams the highest evaluation She is warm , wonderful and brilliant.She gave me the perfect chemo for my age ,health and cancer It's been 3 years and I trust her completely She's the best!	2
She is fantastic, always on point, responsive, and optimistic. She covers all the details and provides all the necessary explanations. She really cares about you and provides a relaxed and humorous atmosphere that is clearly necessary for a cancer patient. 	2
"At one of the most stressful and frightening times in my life, Dr. Adams gave me hope. She has continued to do just that during my monthly visits. A conscientious and caring doctor, she treats her patients with respect, warmth and a sense of humor.  She and her staff are sensitive professionals who always respond to questions during office visits and on the phone between visits. I am so grateful that she is my oncologist. 

"	2
I am a physician and Dr. Sylvia Adams has been treating a family member for over two years. I have been present for all exams and  have found Dr. Adams to be extraordinarily knowledgeable and understanding. She projects just the right mix of compassion and grounded pragmatism. In addition, everyone on her staff, from schedulers to physicians assistants, reflects her empathy, efficiency and skill. The office runs extremely well with short waits and ease in making appointments. She is outstanding.	2
"Dr, Adams is always available and responsive.  In dealing with difficult issues, she takes time to make sure all of the details are well understood.  
It is obvious she and her staff (and the staff of NYUMC in general) are focused on the patient and striving for the best result.  "	2
Dr. Adams is extremely knowledgeable as well as being very kind and easily approached.  I am extremely comfortable with her and know that she is taking excellent care of her patients. Her staff, ie her nurse practitioners are excellent as well, and the office is efficiently and pleasantly run.	2
Dr. Adams is truly an expert in her field. Without her expertise and knowledge, I would probably not be here today.  She is compassionate, warm, and truly cares about the patient experience.  When dealing with cancer, you want to make sure you are in the best hands and there is no one I would recommend more for someone dealing with breast cancer. Dr. Adams has never kept me waiting, has taken the time to learn about my family, and has truly become a friend to me during this journey. 	2
Dr. Adams is the kindest and most compassionate oncologist that I know...and I have been treated by a few in the past 13 years. She is attentive to my concerns. She explains clearly of my results from my scans, whether it's good or bad. She gives me hope as she tries to stay a few steps ahead of my illness.  She will direct me to see other doctors if it's not her areas of expertise. She is someone I can trust. Her staff is unbelievable! I am very lucky to have her as my doctor.	2
from beginning to end the whole process from physician visit to pre register to fast tract, surgery and finally post op was the best I have ever experienced within the medical community. I am a retired RN and know good service when I receive it.	2
Dr. Schmitz was amazing and took the time to explain what my options were and helped me to come up with a plan that was personalized for me. Additionally, her office staff was always polite and helpful whenever I called. I was seen right away when I called with my medical problem.	2
Every visit is easy. Staff is outstanding.  Ever have a long wait. Never feel rushed. Wish all my docs and staff were as good as this outstanding team!	2
Dr Schmidtz staff made my visit so welcoming and comfortable.  Made a very scary situation bearable.	2

Dr. Schmitz was amazing.  She and her team answered all of my questions and were very kind and caring.  I would highly recommend her to anyone.	2
Dr. Mary Jo was fantastic and took wonderful care of my 14 year old daughter. All her office staff were friendly and welcoming to my husband and I and our daughter. Dr. Mary Jo removed a 4 lb cyst and my daughter's ovary and tube. She was wonderful to get us into see her and do surgery the same day. I'm so pleased with how it all worked out. I would highly recommend her for a doctor.	2
I feel very fortunate to have found Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz for my recent hysterectomy.  She provided excellent presurgical counseling about the benefits/ potential risks of the procedure and its value in my case.  As a surgeon, she was extremely competent, kind, and thorough.  She is an excellent communicator who explained the procedure clearly and put me at ease throughout the process.  Her assistant Karen was wonderful too!  I recovered much more quickly than I had expected to which I attribute to the excellent care I received.  I highly recommend Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz and her team!	2
We found Dr schmitz to be very kind caring doctor. We had alot of questions qnd she answered them.didn't rush us.	2
The office was clean and bright and spacious. They had good coffee. I had two sips and they took me to the back. I saw the nurse, and then the doctor came in and did a brief exam, and laid out the plan. I was in the office a total of 20 minutes, and I felt this was plenty of time given the doctors professionalism, not to say her level of caring. By the time I left, I still had half a cup of coffee and it was still hot. The nurses were very good. Incidentally, the doctor has the brightest smile!	2
Dr. Schmitz was amazing! She was able to explain my prognosis and course of action options clearly and made it so me and my family were able to understand what previous doctors could not. She was kind and professional! The whole staff went above and beyond. Plus I have never been in an office were every single person was so positive and kind!	2
"I am so happy that I chose Mary J Schmidt....I would highly recommend her as she
is extremely knowledgeable.
  I was 88 years old....she did a hysterectomy for me and
it was very successful.  I now go every 4 months and she checks me to make sure
no cancer has returned.  I love her....she is so sweet.compassionate and sympathetic.  I made a great choice."	2
Without a doubt I would recommend this office and staff.	2
Dr. Schmitz is a very gentle, knowledgeable and caring doctor. Her staff are, soft spoken, pleasant, caring and knowledgeable nurses and office staff. Considering what I went to see her for I was put at ease and felt very comfortable in the office and exam room.	2
I’ve only seen her once and she was very attentive and knowledgeable, as well as very kind and compassionate. She personally called me with test results and plans for further evaluation.	2
Dr. Schmitz and. her team are wonderful. They listen to my concerns, answer all my questions,  and I feel that all treatment options are explained to my satisfaction. I also think she's the best doctor I've had with regard to vaginal exams. I couldn't feel a thing!! I will always recommend her services if someone is in need. Thank you!	2
Dr. Schmitz is an amazing doctor.  She has exceptional clinical expertise and bedside manner.  She is open-minded to integrative therapies and truly listens to her patients' concerns, which I am truly grateful for.  I was diagnosed in October 2010 Stage IV OC, and I am confident in saying, if it weren't for Dr. Schmitz, I would not be here today.  	2
Dr. Schmitz and her staff are compassionate and caring.  I never feel rushed through appointments, get all my questions answered and always feel comfortable going in.  They are tremendous.	2
If you are searching for an Oncology practice that will treasure you, take excellent care of you and will make you feel that they value you as a human being then search no more.  Dr. Schmitz and her staff are EXCELLENT!	2
This was my first encounter with Dr. Schmitz.  I found her to be friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. I trust her with my care.	2
"Very caring and professional!  Would highly
recommend Doctor Schmitz and all of her staff."	2
"I felt so ""at home"" with Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz and her nurse, Karen.  If I could transplant her to Boulder, I would be very happy!!   She ""listened"" to me and joined me in our mutually accepted plan for me.  I appreciate her very much.  She has a personality that drew me in - and she gives Hugs!!!   I would highly recommend anyone seeking a knowledgable gyn/oncologist, Dr. Mary Jo is the way to go!!!"	2

On your First Class Staff of Angels, I compliment you.  This writing is a recommendation to contact Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz and receive the benefits of her credentialed expertise and intelligent wisdom.  I am one of her many Post-Surgery Fans! 	2
I was referred to Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz.  I found her to be very personable and knowledgeable and she dispelled a lot of anxiety I had prior to the visit with her. I had confidence and a sense of trust in her and that made going forward a lot less stressful for me.  I had a good outcome ultimately, and certainly because of her care and skills as a surgeon.  I would recommend her without a doubt!	2
Dr. Schmitz and her staff are outstanding! I would highly recommend their practice.

"Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz is an outstanding doctor and an exceptional human being, just ask anyone at Swedish Hospital, she's the best and so is her team.

I interviewed several doctors, within a minute, maybe less, I felt like this was my doctor. Engaging, friendly, and involved in my well being and comfort, she  walked me through everything, explained in detail what I was facing. Dr Schmitz is a super confident and competent doctor. I love her and her entire staff, the BEST!"	2
100% would recommend Dr. Schmitz.. She's the best.. Very caring,great bed side manner, takes her time with you to answer any questions you may have.. is the best at what she does.. Thank you Dr. Schmitz for all you do for your patients.. Cindy Tucker	2

She made you feel like you where her only patient, I can't say enough about how important she made you feel!!  The BEST!!!!!	2
I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Schmitz and her staff.  The time, kindness, and care I received was beyond anything I could have expected.  Every encounter, every step of the way was so positive and helpful.  The amount of time they took to work with my insurance and to provide amazing treatment was incredibly impressive.	2
Comfortable and easy to talk to while remaining very professional.	2
Dr. Schmitz is personable, experienced and clearly knows what she's doing.  She listens and answers all questions.  She explains the treatment plan well, making it easy to understand.  I've only met with her once so far, but I really liked her.	2
"My experience with Dr Schmitz and her colleagues was positive and uplifting. I instantly felt that I was in the right place. The whole staff was caring, professional and provided me with the information I needed and had not received from my previous doctor. 
I highly recommend Dr Schmitz and her staff. Erin and Karen will make you feel comfortable and provide you with the information you need."	2
I totally would recommend Dr. Schmitz aka Dr. Mari Jo to patients in need of an expert Gynecologic oncologist. She is very thorough at explaining the issues and the process required for the best outcome. Always ready to answer questions in laymans terms. Expert surgeon as well.	2
Dr Schmitz is caring physician and passionate about her work, she follows up with you personally.	2
Dr Schmitz is the best gyn doctor I have ever been to.  She genuinely listens and cares about her patients well being, as does her nurse Karen.  I wish more doctors and nurses were like them!  	2
As a post surgical cancer patient I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Schmidt and her staff. Their knowledge, patience, skills and patient centric care is outstanding and rare in busy practices where most experiences are like nameless cattle calls. With Dr. Scmidt I have never been rushed never felt uninformed no matter how many times I adk the same question!  The pride she takes in her work is a true gift to her patients. 	2
Dr. Mary Jo Schmitz is a highly competent gynecologic oncologist and surgeon. She skillfully managed treatment of my early stage ovarian cancer from the initial visit to determine the need for surgery and the follow-up chemotherapy.  During this journey, Dr. Schmitz took extra steps in clearly explaining my diagnosis and treatment as well as monitoring my progress.  She also advocated for me when needed. Her positive approach to my care helped me not be fearful of cancer, but to trust.	2
Dr Mary Jo Schmitz is an excellent doctor and surgeon. She is a warm and caring person and takes a sincere interest in not only your health, but who you are as a person. I feel very blessed that I found her when I needed a hysterectomy. It turned out I had cancer too, and when you get a diagnosis like that you need an expert. I have had follow ups for 4 1/2 years since that day and have had wonderful care all along the way. I have total trust in this wonderful doctor. Staff is GREAT too!	2
I'm extremely happy to be a patient of Dr. Schmitz. I trust her decision making, I appreciate her experience. I believe her to be a smart woman. I believe her to be a compassionate person. 	2
Excellent care!	2
I saw her for few years for vaginal dysplasia, and she missed my cancer. She just kept having a couple times of laser surgeries and said I do not have cancer, but actually I already had cancer(I had a second opinion and I was told I had cancer stage 1).  I am disappointed. 	0
Dr. Schmitz is truly a godsend to all of her patients!  She truly cares, is so professional and thorough.

"I feel so blessed that I found Dr. Mary Jo. I think we had an instant connection even before we met, as I took to heart what her fabulous staff had to say about her. Her caring, consideration, thoroughness and impeccable sense of humor and timing meant everything to me. I can't speak highly enough about Dr. Mary Jo, her entire staff, and every nurse who took care of me at Swedish. I wouldn't think of going to anyone else.
Thank you,
Margaret Osso"	2

I was refereed to Dr. Walter after my primary Obgyn gave me a cancer diagnosis. My husband & I feel blessed that we ended up in Dr. Walter's care. He is such a intelligent & compassionate Doctor. We never felt rushed at our appointments, he always listened intently & explained everything very thoroughly! Every other medical professional we met along the way had nothing but praises to say about Dr. Walter as well! He even called us personally a few days after my surgery to give us the great news that I was now cancer free! I could never say enough great things about him & his staff and would recommend him to everyone with a gynecological cancer diagnosis.	2
Dr. Walter is an amazing doctor and surgeon. He did my surgery and I couldn't have asked for a better doctor and he has a wonderful bedside manner. His staff and partners are also wonderful people and I had such a wonderful experience with all of them. If anyone is searching for a great specialist please see Dr. Walter he will take gret care of you.	2
Dr. Walter is one of the most compassionate, understanding and competent doctors I have ever been treated by. He has been with me during a very stressful medical issue and he has kept me informed 100% of the time. Highly recommended this doctor.	2
"I was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year, and was referred to Dr. Walter...who was AMAZING. He was incredibly kind, proficient, and knowledgeable. He discussed different treatment options with me, and explained the pros and cons of all of them. I felt confident going into surgery. 
Also, his office staff and funny, kind, and efficient."	2
I cannot say enough about this wonderful doctor!  His kindness and compassion in addition to his knowledge, made my surgery truly a breeze.  Everything you hope a physician would be and more!!!  Thank you, Dr. Walter.  You and your Staff are amazing!!!	2
Dr. Adam Walter is nothing short of amazing!  We had a big scare with our 17 year old daughter this past summer and Dr. Walter was skilled, knowledgeable, kind, and so compassionate. Throughout the journey, we knew we were led to this awesome surgeon.  We cannot thank him (and his awesome staff) enough.  	2
"I had a abcest  that was infected and was very painful.  He took the time and care to take care of it. he is a very caring doctor in what he does. a very good doctor 
"	2
I am so very blessed to have found Dr. Walter he is kind caring and so very knowledgeable. I finally feel that my journey is headed in the right direction.	2
"Dr. Adam Walter is the whole package. He is a very smart doctor. He has much compassion for his patients and gives 100 percent of himself. I was not the best patient I could have been, He was so kind to me when I was being difficult. I will always be grateful to him being understanding and patience. I wish he was still my Dr., but every thing has it's seasons.and I miss him. I recommend him to others with all my heart.
"	2
Salvo mi vida con su pronto y aserrado tratamiento, que pena que ya no está en Oklahoma, le mando mis mejores deseos y bendiciones. Ya estoy jugando soccer nuevamente!! Lo extraño mucho.   	0
Wow, amazing how doctors would leave fake reviews for themselves! Dr Reid is anything but what the glamorous fake reviews here describe him to be. Why else the reviewers don’t list their name or a real name or at least some specifics. Generic BS and yes I left a review before with a lot of details. Beware of this Dr and Kettering Health network all together, all they are after is your insurance money. 	2
My mother was treated by him, very little to no face time with him, everything is left to his nurse and the PA. side effects of the two rounds of chemo or the post radiation were never explained instead you are handed a piece of paper. At the end and before my mom passed away from what in my opinion was chemo damage to her lymph nodes and digestive tract I called to discuss nutritional support and treatment for her severe oral mucositis and he never returned my call. instead his nurse called me 	0
"When I had my surgery, Dr. Reid was asked to be available ""just in case.""  After surgery, and an unexpected finding of cancer, I specifically remembered thanking doctor Reid for how he explained the situation. He shared information in a gentle, unrushed manner, and in a way my husband and I could understand without making us feel unintelligent. Subsequent visits have also proved to be the same. Office visit waits can sometimes be long, but it is worth the wait to me!"	2
My experience with Dr. Reid has been outstanding.  My situation ended up being extremely unusual, unbeknownst to me.  He did a thorough job explaining why it was peculiar and how to possibly rectify the problem.  He did research and was very conservative in his approach, which I greatly appreciated.  He also wanted a second opinion to ensure the correct actions were taken.  Overall, he is the absolute best doctor I have seen in my 33 years of life.  I would recommend him to anyone!	2
Dr Reid is outstanding! He has done two surgeries and chemo for me. Throughout this difficult process, he patiently and clearly explains the situation, my options and answers all my questions. He is very professional and has a calm, reassuring presence. I highly recommend Dr Reid!	2
Dr. Reid did an awesome job with my surgery.  He was very professional and made me feel confident in him.	2
He is caring, informative and professional.  He explains conditions and options well and lays out all the facts for you to help enable you to make the best decisions for your care.	2
Most outstanding doctor I have ever known!  Has done 2 surgeries on me with absolutely wonderful results.  I am alive today due  to  Dr. Reid!	2

Dr. Scott Richard is an amazing doctor. He did my surgery and got rid of a very serious stage of cancer.  He is very caring and shows genuine interest in how you are doing. He answers all of your questions and does not rush you which I appreciated.  I definitely would recommend him as a doctor if you need gynecological surgery. Luckily he chose Philadelphia to work at. 	2
Dr. Richard is the most caring doctor I have ever met.  From the first time I met him after my cancer diagnosis, he made me feel like everything would be ok....and thankfully it was.  I would highly recommend him to any woman looking for a truly compassionate doctor.  You can't imagine how great he is until you sit and talk with him.  He is the very, very best doctor and was/is my guardian angel.  Thank you, Dr. Richard, for being you and caring so much about your patients.	2

Dr Richard is a warm, friendly, and kind doctor.  He addressed my health issues quickly, provided options for care, and was forthcoming with important information.  The surgery he performed went very smooth, and within 2 weeks, my life had returned to almost completely normal..  I would absolutely recommend him and his office staff as one of the most professional and caring group of people in medicine.  	2
I had a robotic hysterectomy,Despite my unsure nature, he was very compassionate, patient and worked with me all the way to provide what was best for me.I wish I met him before I took the damn contraceptive drugs for many years with deteriorating side effects to my bones just so the monthly bleeding stopped and instead had the surgery which was only a one time discomfort that I even surprisingly recovered quickly from. I highly recommend him because he really is about the patient.	2
I had the pleasure of meeting this wonderful , compassionate, caring, honest, warm, young Doctor last night at Phoenixville Hospital, as he was tending to my dear friend I call Mum. From the second he walked into the room, I knew he was different from other Doctor's! Dr. Richard's your Mom should be one proud Mom! They don't make them like this anymore!!!! Thank you again for being so wonderful with my dear dear friend I call Mum ! 	2
Dr. Richards is a wonderful, compassionate, smart, caring and unselfish man. Before he even knew me (and I was searching for a second opinion) he took my phone call. He explained everything to me in detail, and assured me everything would be ok, and sure enough it was (Surgery on the only ovary I have left - 28 y/o F). This man has patience of a saint, and TRULY loves what he does. I cannot put into words how awesome this man is! I would most DEF recommend him!! Thank you Doc - <3 Gia !!!	2
Dr.Richard is excellent doctor and I highly recommend him to anyone!	2
Excellent doctor! Kind, compassionate and caring.	2
"Just the best. I was extremely nervous about pending surgery but Dr Richard explained everything in detail with patience, grace and humor. Also so responsive to calls to his office, even on a Sunday morning! What a lovely man and excellent Dr.  I would highly recommend him to anyone.
 "	2
Knowledge, experience, explaining procedure and condition, bedside manner, follow up, accessibility are all excellent. I had serious 6 hour surgery to remove a tumor that was intrusive. He was forthright, but  truly showed empathy and concern for me and my family. He is also very funny.	2
"I can't give Dr Richard just 5 stars but all the stars in the sky.
Anyone can go to him blindfolded and they will be ok.
I highly recommend him!
Thank you so much,
Iytan Salhi

Love Dr Richard!  I was 1 of his 1st patients at Magee hospital in Pittsburgh. I was his 1st fistula repair without a colostomy. This wasn't what he wanted to do but was at my request, I knew he could do it!! 	2
"The absolutely best surgeon! 
He saved my life and my limbs!"	2
Dr Wittig removed a mass from my shoulder that turned out to be benign, repaired a tear, and removed a cyst from my shoulder bone. Almost five months later and I’m almost fully functional with help of physical therapy. No problems at all during recovery. He is very personable and competent and his staff is wonderful, especially his PA, Connie Chong and PA-C, Jillian Thomas. They were all highly accessible and responsive to my questions and concerns, night or day. I can most confidently recommend Dr Wittig to anyone needing an orthopedic oncologist.	2
"Awful experience. Hip Surgery left me with one leg 1 1/2"" shorter than the other. Wittig denied it profusely, despite 3 other doctors confirming it. Dr. never came to see me after surgery, and wouldnt see me during follow ups. His PA was very nice but could never answer any questions so I finally had to ""insist"" on him seeing me.   Thanks to Dr Wittig, I had to get another surgery with a different/better doctor to make my legs even again.  AVOID!!!"	0
Dr. Wittig is the best physician I have ever encountered. An MRI of my 20-year old daughter indicated a sarcoma (cancer) in her shoulder. Living in NYC, we were referred to a NYC orthopedic oncologist. We could not get even a consultation for a month. I came across Dr. Wittig’s name late on a Friday evening and emailed him my daughter’s MRI report. Early Saturday morning, he had already responded to my message and scheduled an appointment for Monday — even though he was supposed to be on vacation. He scheduled surgery within a few weeks and we received great news that our daughter’s tumor was benign. Dr. Wittig is surrounded by a team that is extremely caring and competent.	2
I have been under Dr. Wittig’s and his PA Ms. Connie Chong’s care for two years for imaging and observation of what fortunately has turned out to be a benign growth that will not require surgical intervention. I cannot adequately express how high the level of care has been. It is simply exemplary and all physicians in this country should strive to meet the high standards of compassionate and effective care that Dr. Wittig and Ms. Chong maintain. They are the best!!!!	2
My experience with Dr. Wittig was amazing.  He made me feel so comfortable from the time he walked into the exam room.  I knew immediately that I was in good hands.   My surgery went very well, and his bedside manner was amazing.  His staff is just as amazing as he is, very helpful in the office and on the phone.  I could not have asked for a better Doctor.	2
"April 2018 I walked into my primary care physician and was dx. With a rare bone cancer/tumor Chondrosarcoma,never heard of that word in all my 46 years even with my medical background. I googled the dx on you tube and found Dr.James Wittig and god directed me straight to his ofc. The day My family and I met Dr.Wittig was the day I knew I was in great hands. THIS MAN IS ABOVE AND BEYOND AN EXCELLENT EXCEPTIONAL ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.
Dr.Wittig and his team are all heaven sent! This man is AMAZING!!!"	2
I have been going to Dr. Wittig since 2015 for surgery and follow-up treatment for a soft tissue sarcoma. This is Dr. Wittig's specialty and I could not be in better hands. He is an amazing surgeon and gifted doctor. Consider yourself lucky if you are one of his patients as you will receive the finest, competent, professional and compassionate care from both Dr. Wittig and his staff. An excellent doctor in every respect.	2
Updating previous review, the doctor failed to obtain clean margins after my resection, the pathologist said I was clear but was either incompetent or just boosting wittigs numbers. When fox chase got my slides they said there was obvious evidence of residual disease. They changed my treatment based on a report of “ successful surgery” and advised survallience by the time they caught the mistake it was too late cancer spread to my lungs. So ty dr wittig and your team for failing every aspect. 	0
Dr. Wittig is a highly skilled and most humane and caring physician.  My first consultation was a reassuring experience.  Though he explained that the rather rare and problematic disease affecting my knee would require two consecutive surgeries to repair, he radiated confidence and compassion.  He took time to get to know me as a person.  The day after my second surgery, he drove over half an hour from his home to the hospital specifically to see how I was faring.  Dr. Wittig is the best!	2
Dr. Wittig's passion for helping his patients is simply unparalleled. He is genuinely kind and caring, as he demonstrated by completely addressing my concerns and compassionately relating to my situation.  My surgery was significant, but I was up and walking the next day and back at the gym 5 weeks later.  This is further testament to Dr. Wittig's skill.   He saved my leg and my life, and I will continue to recommend him to friends and loved ones.	2
I can not say enough about Dr. Wittig and his staff. He is kind , generous and patient with his time and his knowledge. He and his staff provided me with a calm , caring and loving environment to tackle my stage 3 sarcoma.(of which I did twice ;) EVERYONE on the staff are sublime and are always willing to go the extra distance to secure an appt, sit down and chat , deal with insurance issues etc....they are impecciably organized and efficent. I am lucky to have them as my team.I highly reccomend	2
"My husband, Tom Artin, had given up hope after years of suffering from a large cell tumor. No other surgeons would operate given the delicacy and intricacy of the surgery required to remove a PVNS tumor embedded in his right knee and leg. 

Dr. Wittig immediately understood the diagnosis, scheduled two surgeries, completely removed the tumor (two operations), replaced the knee, and rebuilt Tom's leg. In less than three months, Tom is completely healed! Amazing."	2
"Dr James Wittig is ""THE"" Orthopedic Oncologist to have to preform the delicate and complicated surgery on my Husband.  Dr Wittigs's experience and knowledge saved Mike's leg and being at HUMC gave us the ability to be referred to the best in oncology at the John Theurer Cancer center. Dr Wittig is not only THE BEST in his field of surgery but he is down to earth and gives you the time you need to discuss your health and is interested in YOU as a person, All staff members will be there for YOU"	2
Dr. Wittig is remarkable! I have a reoccurring intramuscular lipoma that had been removed twice by other surgeons. When It returned the third time, I found Dr. Wittig and discussed my situation. He explained exactly what he would do and scheduled me quickly.  This time surgery was quicker and less painful. Dr. Wittig made me feel confident and secure, and he was right! Follow up care and my time in Hackensack Hospital was amazing! So lucky to find him! Office staff is amazing anc caring, too!	2
"My fiancé had a fractured humerus. Wittig did not examine him for weeks. Sent his PAs. Wittig did NOT operate on fracture for THREE WEEKS. He went on vacation. Represented would operate on his return.  Then bumped him 3x!!!
We asked PA to have Wittig come to hospital room after he postponed surgery 3D time. NEVER came to room. NEVER called. "	0
The professionalism of Dr. Wittig and his clinic staff and the care we had at the hospital was amazing.  At every stage of my son’s treatment at his clinic, before and after the surgery, we prayed to thank God for allowing us to meet Dr. Wittig and have the chance to have our son treated by such a gifted doctor, whose dedication to medicine and science can be seen by looking in eyes his. We cannot offer enough thanks to his wonderful team including the other doctors, nurses and office staff. 	2
After an initial hand surgery by another physician that was supposed to be a simple removal of an enchondroma (but turned out to be a giant cell tumor of the bone) I then went to Dr. Wittig to have it redone and removed the correct way. He knew exactly how to take care of it and I have had excellent results with the post-surgery rehab. I can highly recommend Dr. Wittig as he is definitely the person I would trust my life with.	2
I was referred to Dr. Wittig by my oncologist.  I consider myself very lucky.  I have a very aggressive, rare cancer.  Dr. Wittig saved my arm and my life.  I am so very grateful.  This man is a blessing and I would recommend him in a heartbeat.  His knowledge, credentials and expertise are unequalled as far as I am concerned.	2
I can easily begin with deep appreciation for Dr. Wittig's skill in saving my arm.  The surgery I was to have elsewhere was to remove my arm where cancer was found. My son immediately found Dr. Wittig. So, I have my arm in tact and in full use. I shouldn't have to say more, but there is so much more to say. He rose above the aloofness found in so many doctors and extended unusual kindness and consideration to us. The professional staff he surrounds himself with are also equal to his character.	2
Being referred to an oncologist is a scary prospect but from the beginning I knew that I had found the right man.  Dr. Wittig is caring,competent & kind.  His entourage of staff doctors & nurses have been carefully mentored to provide the best possible service.  They were with me daily when I was hospitalized. When I mentioned Dr. Wittig's name, his praises were sung by anyone who had met him or needed his service. In my fragile condition, the team was brainstorming to ensure I had my needs met.	2
Dr. Wittig and his entire staff were wonderful.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about them.  His receptionist Erin got me an appointment very quickly.  Helen, his nurse, spent a great deal of time on the phone with me to ease my fear and anxiety.  Both physician assistants, Connie and Erin were so helpful.  Dr. Wittig himself spent a great deal of time with me and thoroughly explained everything.  Thank goodness for this office.	2
I had a bone tumor and was told by another orthopedist that I may lose my foot because of it. I saw Dr. Witting and he explained that he would remove the tumor and that I would not lose my foot. Dr. Witting is a wonderful doctor. He explains everything, he is very thoughtfull and friendly and does beautiful work. I would recommend him to everyone.  I trust him completely.	2
Had a benign tumor in my right shoulder. My experience with Dr. Wittig from beginning to end was wonderful. 	2
I've been a patient of Dr. Wittig since September 2010.  He treated me for a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma of my right lower leg.  Dr. Wittig is personable, extremely knowledgeable, thorough in explaining the condition you have and course of treatment which will be necessary.  Dr. Wittig has tremendous concern for his patients and their well-being.  He does not rush when giving you an exam and the patient gets his full undivided attention.  I highly recommend Dr. Wittig.	2
Dr. Wittig probably saved my life. Oncologists told me I hprobably had a non-cancerous mass resting on nerve. 10 Days afterDr. Wittig removed the mass, pathology confirmed cancer. That day a pet scan showed no cancer. The following day the nerve, sheath and margins were removed. Dr. Wittig worked with Drs. Pecora and Ingenito to devise a chemo and radiation plan. I feel I have a team focused on me winning this fight with Dr. Wittig it's quarterback. 	2
500 character is not enough to say how wonderful DR. Wittig is. I wholeheartedly echo the glowing reviews of others. My son was away at college when a lesion was discovered after mildly complaining of knee pain. I flew down to take him to doctors, made many calls looking for the best doctor and was in panic mode. My son came home to NJ and we met with Dr.Wittig. Within 10 minutes I knew my son was in good hands. I trusted him with sons life, as a mother there is no stronger endorsement. 	2
I am truly fortunate and blessed to have met Dr. Wittig and that he was the surgeon who performed the very complex procedure to remove my sarcoma. Dr. Wittig is an extremely gifted surgeon and a very patient and caring man. He takes all the time necessary to help me and my family understand everything about my life changing diagnosis. Dr. Wittig’s and his staff’s knowledge and competence provide me the assurance I am under the best care possible. Special thanks to Helen, Erin, Connie and Jill.	2
Dr. Wittig and his staff are amazing! Immediately upon meeting Dr. Witting, I felt comfortable in his care.  He was calming at a time when we felt the most crazed.  He sat with us and discussed everything in detail from what each test was for, my diagnosis and the plan of action (both short & long term).  His ENTIRE staff is truly remarkable.  I felt like my entire health journey was a team effort and EVERYONE there played a major part in my good health & happiness, now! 	2
I am a patient and also a physician. Dr. Wittig and his staff provide the absolute best medical care  I have ever experienced. His reputation as the best in the field is absolutely accurate and earned.	2
It was determined I had a large mass in my calf muscle.Five different doctors all told me to see Dr. Wittig.  I was able to get an appointment very quickly, much quicker than I had expected. From the moment I met him I just knew that he was the right doctor for me.  He has an extremely warm presence about him and not disconnected like I find most doctors in his field to be.I just knew that everything would be ok and that I was in the right hands.  I would happily recommend him to anyone.  	2
In regards to Dr. Wittig in his expertise as a doctor & surgeon was a very positive experience for me.  Him and his staff were extremely professional, kind and courteous throughout my treatment.  Being told I had cancer was a very traumatic experience however Dr. Wittig had assured me he would do everything possible to help me which is exactly what he did.  Dr. Wittig is a very brilliant and amazing doctor, surgeon and man.  I will be forever grateful to him for saving and giving me my life back	2
Very caring, professional and skilled.  Hard to get an appointment, but worth the wait.	2
He takes the time to listen and explains things in ways I understand.	1
Prior to surgery nurses were making fun of his name but concluded saying they would trust only him if they needed an operation. Ask about him in the waiting room of the hospital and you get the same response, added to that he is said to be the only one to come down without fail to see the family when he is finished with the surgery (no matter how busy he is), as he did for my husband. Dr.V had his nurse call my husband every thirty minutes to keep him informed about the surgery...	1
Very humble, yet confident. I immediately felt at ease and trusted him. A christian man that took the time to pray with me before surgery. Never did I feel rushed or pressured. He took the time to answer all my questions. 	2
What distinguishes this GYN practice is both compassionate staff and the expertise of Dr. Ripley.  She is an oncologist surgeon with skills that are exemplary in a community with several surgeon.  However, her surgical expertise and her diagnostic skills combine to make her uniquely superior in her field.	2
Office staff are great and Dr. Ripley is wonderful.  Appointments are always on time and they take plenty of time explaining everything.  Would not want to be in anybody else's hands!	2
Dr Ripley and her nurse practitioner Elaine we're extremely informative during my visit.  I felt comfortable asking questions.  They spoke to me at my level of knowledge making everything easy to understand.  I am scheduled for surgery and I trust Dr Ripley for my best outcome.	2
Best Doctor EVER!!!	2
My wife, sister-in-law were pleased and impressed with the handling of my wife's care and instructions as to the presedures that are to follow! The office staff and assistants were very helpful during our visit!               Dr. Ripley is a caring person that answers any and all questions that we asked, and looks you in the eye when addressing you, ( a lost art these days ). 	2
Her care was above and beyond any care I have ever had. Also her staff is awesome.	2
I found the medical assistant very thorough and pleasant and willing to answer any questions.  Dr. Ripley was very pleasant, personable and very  professional.  I liked both of them very much and felt I was in good hands.	2
Dr. Ripley and her staff are very knowledgeable, informative, friendly and courteous.  I would definitely recommend her to friends and family.  The only reason my total wait times were a little longer was that it was an initial consult and also an appointment to plan for surgery so I was meeting with multiple people.	2
"The entire staff at Dr Ripley's office were welcoming and very friendly.  Dr Ripley was very knowledgeable relative to women's health issues. She put me at ease right away.
"	2
I would certainly recommend Dr. Ripley and her team to anyone looking for an experienced, compassionate, professional in the field of oncology. 	2
I was totally amazed at how quickly Dr. Ripley gave me an appointment! I did this on my own, I was not referred by another doctor. Everyone in her office was very kind and courteous. From Penny, her office coordinator, to Debbie and Toni, LPNs, Elaine, her ARNP was amazing, and the doctor herself was caring and concern personified. Very professional and I was put so at ease! I was given a surgery date and am very pleased with the whole process. I trust Dr. Ripley implicitly.	2
It’s so very important to feel comfortable and confident about the type and quality of care and concern you’re getting; that’s why I will continue to trust Dr. Daylene Ripley and her staff with my care and would recommend them highly!	2
Dr Ripley is very professional and competent.  Although I am a new patient and have had only one office visit, I was impressed by her and her entire staff.	2
Dr. Ripely and all her staff were wonderful. I would recommend her to anyone in need of her services. The entire office goes above and beyond to make patients feel comfortable.	2
"Very friendly, knowledgeable and professional staff. They make you feel at home and ready to help you succeed in your treatment. 
I will recommend Dr Ripley and staff to others as well.
"	2
"I  would recommend Dr. Ripley to my friends and family.  Worth the drive...….
"	2
I found Dr. Ripley to be not only professional and knowledgeable but compassionate, patient, quick witted and witty.  I highly recommend this practice to everyone including my daughter and granddaughter.  If that's not a compliment and vote of confidence.... Then none can be had. 5 star across the board for Dr. Ripley and staff.	2
Between Dr. Ripley, ARNP Zapata and her excellent staff I can't say enough good about this practice. Highly recommend to anyone with GYN related cancers. All questions answered, fears talked about, recommendations spoke about  and fabulous follow-up. Although I hope to never have need of their excellent services again, they will always have my respect and gratitude.	2
My first visit to Dr. Ripley's office was good. Dr. Ripley listened very well to what I had to say.  She is went over my test results very well. After the consultation she explained to me in great detail of what was needed for my health issues.  The staff there is very kind, courteous and professional. The office atmosphere is pleasantly calming. I would recommend Dr. Ripley to anyone if needed. Thank you Dr. Ripley for keeping my mind at ease.	2
"I first contacted Dr Ripley's office by telephone. My questions about becoming a new
patient were answered, and the process of referral explained. My file was received by
Dr Ripley's office, and a new patient appointment was set. Scheduling was simple, easy.

The appointment was on schedule. Assistants, Nurse Practicioner 
welcoming and thorough. The office was quiet, uncrowded.  Dr Ripley
was a burst of friendly professionalism. The physical exam quick, without
discomfort.  A care plan made.

"	2
I would most certainly recommend Dr. Ripley.  She and everyone on her staff was cordial, helpful, and well informed.  They explained things to me in a manner I could easily understand, and took the time to listen to  any questions I may have.  The atmosphere in that office was one of relaxed, competent calm which was refreshing.	2
The entire staff is so friendly. They make you feel like family.	2
Very comfortable environment. Staff is very warm and accommodating. From the minute I walked into the office I knew I was in good hands. Dr. Ripley is awesome. She is very personable and made me feel very secure in what I was about to face. I would highly recommend her!	2
I had a very positive and educational experience.  Dr. Ripley and her staff answered my questions and gave me some ideas on how to help myself.  They were gracious and thoughtful.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a caring doctor and staff that is knowledgeable and courteous.	2
The best in the area. Kind and compasionate. Staff is wonderful	2
I really felt at home.  Like I've known the doctor FOREVER!	2
As a several-year patient of Dr. Ripley, it is my opinion that she is what any woman would want in a physician/surgeon: superior understanding of gynecological cancers, training at the best cancer hospitals, exceptional talent and vast experience with the most effective surgical techniques, board-certification in gynecology-oncology, complete dedication to her patients AND she is the kindest, easiest-to-talk-with doctor I've every known. You won't find a finer physician than Dr. Ripley.	2
Wonderful Dr.& her staff (all) are just as wonderful and very caring??I've been telling everyone ( family & customers in my business also tha ode needing a great caring Doctor she's the best so is her PA too!!!! I will never go anywhere else when I need a Dr...... their all fantastic!!!!	2
I went to Dr. Ripley because of a recommendation from a friend. I am so glad I did. The office staff is professional but friendly and make you feel like you're important. Not just another number. Dr. Ripley performed my surgery and all went as planned. She is a very competent and is admired by all the persons I spoke to. 	2
What a great experience I have had at Dr. Ripley's office.. Her entire staff is top notch.	2
Professional & caring physician.  Highly recommend.  Entire staff is excellent and I feel cared about.	2
I recently found I had Uterine Cancer. Then I heard about Dr Daylene Ripley, made my apt, our first visit my husband and I were very nervous about the Cancer. Dr Ripley and her staff was amazing, I felt like I was with family, she explained everything so clearly,  assured us I would be fine. The surgery went well, Hospital was a great experience. Dr Ripley was there for me the whole way. Thank you Dr Ripley I am truly blessed to have Dr Ripley !! I recommend Dr Ripley to everyone she's the Best 	2
My experience was nothing but positive. Dr. Ripley was very personable and made me feel very comfortable. Her staff was also excellent. I was treated like a life long patient although I had just met them. also with dignity and respect. The knowledge and professional manner in which only someone with great compassion and dedication can accomplish. Thank You!	2
Dr. Ripley and her office are the most professional, kind, informative office I have ever encountered.  Every aspect of helping my 83 year old mother through her new found ovarian cancer has been uplifting, and while not painting a rosy picture, gives us truthful, positive results that can happen.  Momma had her port put in by Dr. Ripley last Monday, and it was as if it wasn't even there!  Momma's own words!  	2
Dr. Ripley was amazing.  She specializes in pelvic mass removal.  I had a very complex issue.  She performed my surgery at North Florida Regional Hospital in Gainesville, Florida.  My results were perfect.  I highly, highly recommend Dr. Daylene Ripley to any female with a pelvic issue requiring surgery.  Dr. Ripley is very knowledgeable, warm, caring and compassionate.  	2
What an amazing office.  Everyone in the office was so welcoming, kind, friendly, understanding, and put my husband and I at ease the minute we walked in.  I could not have asked for anything more from the staff, or the nurses at Swedish.  I went in to my first visit and did not really know what to expect, but Dr. Davis explained it all to my husband and I in a very detailed manner, but at the same time put our minds at ease.  We both felt much better after we knew what to expect both during and after.  I can honestly say, although the procedure was mentally and physically traumatic, Dr. Davis and the OR staff and nurses made it as positive an experience as possible.	2
Dr. Davis is professional, caring and cares about his patients.  His staff is amazing! You will not find a better Oncology Gynecologist anywhere.	2
"I was very appreciative of Dr. Davis and the care he gave me. I've been through surgeries before where the surgeon is mostly ""business"" and I appreciate Dr. Davis' caring and empathy toward me and my condition. I brought a family member with me to meet him, and we both walked away from the initial consultation feeling confident I was in very good hands. He and his team got me in for surgery quickly,  and his staff have been nothing but kind and helpful to me, both at the consultation and post surgery."	2
I found Dr. Davis and his entire staff to be kind, professional and caring.  I felt that I received top notch treatment every step of the way.  My heartfelt Thanks.	2
Dr. Davis is a wonderful person and I felt at ease right away...… if you need someone really caring and understanding I highly rank this facility...… Dr. Davis is one of the most respectful persons I know.....the staff is the same way!!!!….Lots of love and concern here...… they make you feel like family!!!!!	2
Dr. Davis has been patient with my health questions and ultimately performed my needed surgery.  He and his staff are kind and heart felt.	2
Always pleasant, affable, knowledgeable, current, on top of things.	2
"Just 20 days from turning 89, Dr. Davis removed an ovarian cyst about the size of a large grapefruit. I spent one night at Swedish hospital and went home the next day.      I know I have been ""worked on""  but I have no need for pain meds. I did take a pain med the first night home for a ""good night's sleep""  daVinci surgery is amazing!!"	2
I cannot say enough good things about an all amazing office.  The entire staff is very kind, they are the greatest.  Dr.Davis is caring, very nice, professional, and respectful.  Sincerely, Marie S.	2
I wrote the wrong time down for my appointment; consequently, I was 45 minutes late (thinking I was early).  The receptionist assured me it was quite ok.  I was pretty scared about the cancer word but the entire staff was so attentive and kind, it reassured me that I was at the right place.  The Doctor explained everything to me even as to a sketch of the procedure to be done.  I came away much more relaxed and certainly more informed.	2
I had endometrial cancer three years ago.  I didn't know where to turn and my Primary Physician did some research and came up with Dr. Davis.  He was my savior.  He explained my condition and how he was going to deal with it.  Via a robot, I had a radical hysterectomy, and needed no follow-up treatment.  Karen, his assistant, is the absolute best and the two of them are a great team together.  I couldn't say enough good things about Dr. Davis or anybody on his staff.  They are the greatest	2
He is kind, feeling, very smart about medical problems, I have been with Dr Davis since 2003 and I am still alive and in his care.  OH and he is alway fun and always has a smile until he gets down to business.  Great Doctor!	2
Dr. Davis takes excellent care of his patients.  I first met him in May 2010.  He immediately took care of my situation.  I can’t express the gratitude enough that I have for this man.  I know in my heart that he saved my life.  Thank you Dr. Davis.  May God Bless you always!	2
Dr. Davis has been my Oncologist for over 13 years.  He is warm, funny, caring and thorough.  I will not go to another Oncologist as long as I can go to Dr. Davis.	2
"I was diagnosed with Endometrial Cancer (uterine) on October 25th by my OBGYN, Dr. Jacqueline Garrard.  She had me connected with Dr. Kevin Davis and his team within 24 hours.  

I was scheduled for a consultation on November 20th and surgery on November 22st.  He and his team were amazing, kind, compassionate and  were available to answer any question I had at any time.  My consultation was seemless, and the procedure couldn’t have gone better."	2
I couldn’t have asked for a better doctor or care for my recent surgery!  I was most impressed with Dr. Davis and his staff on all counts.  He respected my imput and decisions letting me make my own choices after informing me what all the surgery entails and what he recommends.  It was a very positive experience!	2
"Dr. Davis is always very professional and very caring.  He listens to your worries and always makes me feel comfortable and assured that he will
do the best for me.  "	2
Everyone at this office is fantastic!!! They are so caring and helpful.	2
I was nervous; have never had much illness and this sounds pretty serious. Dr. Davis was clear, did not talk down to me, answered questions, and was positive. I left feeling that I can do this--whatever the result. I am relieved (well, as much as possible) and hope I prove to be a good and cooperative patient. Thanks to all of you.	2
Dr. Davis is wonderful.  He thoroughly explained the upcoming surgery in his office patiently and professionally.  The day of surgery, he came by to see if I was ready and he came by after the surgery to tell me that all went well.  I am extremely thankful that he has the experience to be proficient in robotic surgery as I was able to leave the hospital the same day as surgery.  He called me after surgery to ensure all was well.  I was back to picking up my 2 year old grandson within 2 weeks!	2
"Dr Davis and his wonderful staff make
the scary fear of gynecological cancer much less scary!  Dr Davis is a wonderful kind and compassionate doctor. He asks good questions and LISTENS to every concern. I am alive due to Dr Davis and his staff!   I have been ovarian and uterine cancer free for TEN years July  2018. I am blessed to have the continued medical and emotional support Dr Davis and his staff have given to me.  Karen and Judy are caring kind support to Dr Davis’ medical  expertise!!!"	2
I feel so blessed and thankful to have found Dr Kevin Davis and his whole team. They are there for me no matter what and their support has been amazing!!	2
 I was referred to Rocky Mountain Gynecological Oncology for surgery of a very large ovarian cyst and precancerous cells in my cervix.  When I called for an appointment the RMGO office was amazing.  They scheduled me for a pre op appointment with Dr. Davis and coordinated the approval of my insurance for surgery.  The surgery was scheduled quickly (at my request) and Dr. Kevin Davis was compassionate, kind and a brilliant surgeon that made me feel comfortable at such a traumatic time of my life.	2
"I have been a patient of Kevin Davis, MD and his staff at Rocky Mountain Gynecologic Oncology for several years and I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs a top notch doctor who is on your side 100% in getting you through your difficult times and needs.  I can't say enough about Dr Davis and the wonderful people who work with him.
"	2
"Dr. Davis instilled confidence in me from the first visit. He explained thoroughly what my illness was, how severe it was, as well as the explicit procedure to cure me. And that's exactly what he did.  
His upbeat demeanor and humor make each office visit for follow-up check-ups almost fun.  He's a good doctor. (And there is very little wait time in the office for your appointment.)"	2
My wife needed a hysterectomy.  Dr. Davis was able to expedite the necessary (robotic) surgery the same week ('met him on Monday, 'had the surgery on Wednesday).    He is kind, informative, and one of the top experts in this type of surgery.  We are extremely grateful to have gotten him and will highly recommend him to others.  I will add that his office staff were/are very helpful (particularly as our PCP's referral staff proved difficult) in getting all the necessary paperwork done.  	2
My husband and I had complete faith in Dr. Davis the moment he spoke with us regarding my procedure.  He made us feel very at ease even though our anxiety level was running very high.  The staff made us feel cared about before, during and after.  I would highly recommend Dr. Davis and his staff.	2
Dr. Davis is a wonderful, caring, competent oncologist.  I feel blessed to have him in charge of my care. His staff is amazing and supportive. 	2
"Extremely confident with Dr. Davis in every aspect.
Knowledgeable, caring, respectful!  Staff is also
caring and comforting."	2
Dr Davis and staff are wonderful and I am glad that my other Dr referred me to them I would definitely recommend to others Thank you for the time and care you have given me	2
I have been a nurse for 35 years and worked many offices.  Dr. Davis's staff was the most warm and caring group of women and the overall office feel made you feel special and safe.  Dr. Davis is kind, informative, an expert at his field and doesn't rush with your appointment.  I met him for a consultation on a Thursday and had surgery the following Wednesday.  He followed up post op, as well as his staff did. I felt in good hands from the initial call through my hospital stay. 	2
The BEST!  Very thorough and knowledgeable. The best in making a paient comfortable about seeing an oncologist! Love his nurse. Just the BEST team I have ever had. 	2
My daughter was seen by Dr. Davis to have a large mass removed, in addition to a complete hysterectomy.  On our initial visit, Dr. Davis explained things thoroughly, drawing pictures and making notations to make sure we understood what needed to be done.  He was patient and kind, asking frequently if we had any questions. As he explained the surgical procedure in detail, we were able to feel extrememly confident in his abilities.  His post-surgery discussions with us were easily understood.	2
My dr referred me to him totally ridiculous trying to get an appointment can’t talk to anybody only can leave messages don’t see how that is any help because no one evers calls you back make me question my dr now that she would refer her patients their	0
I absolutely will recommend Dr. Pugmire to friends, family, even a stranger if asked.  He definitely knows his specialty!!!!  I was admitted through the ER.  A cat scan showed a large mass involving my entire abdominal cavity.  It was suspect to be cancer.  After a 3 hour surgery,  the mass, ovaries, and appendix all were removed.  Dr.Pugmire, perform the surgery robotically.  Amazing!!!!  The great news was it was NOT cancer!  It was a cyst, that developed on my ovary.  He’s awesome!	2
Dr Pugmire is an excellent doctor.  in 2008 I was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer. Dr Pugmire did my surgery and has taken care of me since then. He did an excellent job with the surgery but also always has treated me with kindness and with care.  I love that he always explains things well to me. He and his staff have quickly responded when I needed something, even now 10 years later.  I now have to drive 1 1/2 hours to see him. But gladly do for this excellent care. 	2
Dr. Pugmire and his staff are amazing.  I was diagnosed with uterine cancer in February 2017.  I was referred to Dr. Pugmire and surgery as well as chemo was recommended.  Dr. Pugmire and his excellent and his excellent staff there and available every step of the way.  Highly recommended.	2
very good doctor explains everything, very nice doctor and so is his staff.	2
Very kind, very professional and I wish my mother, who died of ovarian cancer had had him for her doctor. 	2
He fully explained what needed to be done and took the time to answer any questions I had.  He was kind and put me at ease. I was taken very good care of.	2
I have had issues with cervical dysplasia numerous times.  My OB/Gyn didn't have a good follow up in place with me for this.  I seeked Dr. Pugmire and it was the best thing I could have ever done.  His follow up with the patients is impeccable.   His exams are painless.   I just love Dr. Pugmire and his staff.  You always know you are in good hands with Dr. Pugmire.  I highly recommend him.	2
"Dr. Pugmire is a miracle worker.  I was a high-risk patient & no other doctor would perform surgery on me.  He performed three complicated surgical procedures on me in a three-hour period & I went home the next day, feeling better than I had in decades.  

Dr. Pugmire is highly-skilled, knowledgeable, & extremely compassionate.  He spends as much time as a patient needs in order to have all their issues addressed to their satisfaction.  I would highly recommend him to any high-risk patient."	2
Excellent Doctor!! His surgical skills and follow up care is impeccable!!  Highly recommend Dr. Pugmire.	2
He helped me with my cancer of Non-Hoskins lymphoma, I have been cancer free for 20 years, I always liked him, because he went straight to the point and took care of it, I have found out as of today that my cancer is back, I wish I could go back to him, but he is to far away.	2

Dr. Seward is amazing. I was refereed to her after learning I had an ovarian mass. Of course, like anyone with this diagnosis I was nervous and afraid of what I would find out. The moment I met her she made me feel at ease. She is kind, professional and thorough. She explained everything perfectly, she did not rush the visit and when I left her office I felt good about the plan. Today I hadn’t my total hysterectomy and every aspect was perfect. Thank you Dr. Seward! 	2
Very intelligent, straight forward and compassionate. Excellent bedside manner. I was absolutely terrified about my diagnosis. I really felt I had the best doctor and really trusted her knowledge, expertise and experience. I can't even explain how incredibly thankful I am for this amazing lady.	2
Dr. Jaeckle takes the time to answer your questions and explains your condition in plain English. His knowledge of brain tumors and current research is superior. Nurse Kathy (his left hand) is also great. 	2
Dr. Phibbs saved my life.  He continues to care about me as a patient and about me as a person.  He is skilled. He is compassionate.  He is kind.	2
Dr. Phibbs saved my life.  He is the reason I am here today.  I recommend him without reservation.  	2
I thank Dr. Garth Phibbs. I am here today because of him. He saved my life. With his wisdom I'm 16 years Ovarian Cancer free. His staff was amazing. He has one of the best bedside manner's I have experienced. He was welcoming, reassuring. I was young and scared he took that fear away from me.	2
"Dr. Phibbs is my gyn/oncologist.  He preformed my surgery for Ovarian Cancer and I have been NED for a year this month!  (Dec of 16)   He is the BEST and I love his staff so much!!!  I totally recommend!
"	2
"Dr. Phibbs  performed my surgery and is the BEST gynecological surgeon in Toledo, OH.  In fact, my husband is a gynecologist and has worked with Dr. Phibbs recommending him to his patients who have
problems that are more complicated.  If you want a physician who is the best in his field, I suggest you get an appointment with him. His patient base also is proof of his outstanding service to his patients.  He is very busy but always makes time to see a patient who needs his expert care.  "	2
I've been a patient if Dr. Phibbs for 20 years and highly recommend him. Superb surgical expertise and a super nice guy. 	2
He is an excellent surgeon and doctor, but has no bedside manner.	0
Wonderful doctor...saved my life.  Very easy to talk to.	2
He is to the point and honest, but one heck of a surgeon, and I cannot thank him enough. 	2
Dr. Chase is simply the best. Communicates well, listens to your concerns, and clearly offers treatment options. Her surgical skills are impressive. My July 29 surgery left me with very neat incision sites, great follow-up care, and a quick recovery. AZ Oncology's staff is cheerful, efficient, and seems to share Dr. Chase's objective to get patients better quickly with as little pain as possible.	2
Was treated like a number with Dr. Chase her office staff was very insensitive and rude. I was hospitalized and was told she would call us as a courtesy follow up since we never got to see her. She never called us, I was left in the dark. I had a massive tumor attached to my uterus. When i called the office the staff couldn't care less. I switched to a more empathetic Dr. with excellent staff he is the Dir. of the GYN oncology division at Scottsdale healthcare. He removed my tumor within a week.	0
I felt that I was in excellent care with Dr Chase. 	2
Dr. Chase made me feel well-informed about my cancer: answered all of my questions, let me know the different options for treatment and what would be the best treatment for me.  She was straight-forward about my condition (which I appreciated). As busy as she is, she always made sure my questions were answered and didn't rush through the appointments.	2
Dr. Saul was recommended by my GYN and my primary care doctor.  Both told me that I would love him and they were right.  He is very professional and at the same time warm and caring.   He made me feel comfortable, safe,  and put my fears to rest.	2
Best Doctor around. Would highly recommend him to anyone.	2
He is very thorough and personable! As a young patient, I felt comfortable and easy to talk with him! Very glad I was referred to him!	2
Dr Saul operated on me 13 years ago and I have followed up with him since then. I highly recommend him as a professional and excellent physician. He coordinated my surgery with 2 other surgical specialists and my progress and recovery were due to his dedication and care. I have referred other people to him and they too have had the same excellent experience and outcome. I continue to highly recommend Dr. Saul as a doctor who is thorough and truly cares about his patients!	2
Dr. Saul spent time explaining my medical issue.  He is kind and understanding	2
"I recently had the robotic procedure to have a hysterectomy.  Dr. Saul explained the procedure.  He is very easy to talk to and answers questions.  He also is quite the magician as he does magic tricks.  
 "	2
Dr Saul is a very caring doctor.  I felt very comfortable with him from the moment I met him.  He is a great magician also.  I was refered to him by my GYN.  He talked me through all the pros and cons of having a hysterectomy.  He preformed the surgery and found other issues, which he took care of.  He was wonderful keeping my family informed of my condition while I was in recovery.  I have fully recovered from the surgery with no complications.  Thanks to Dr Saul and the Big Guy Upstairs.  	2
I meet Dr Saul right before he was scheduled to do my surgery. While waiting to go into the OR, each nurse walking by said how lucky I was to have him doing the surgery. When he walked up to see me, I instantly felt very comfortable with him. He was very reassuring and caring. It’s fun to finish your visit with a magic trick which he is very good at. 	2
Dr. Saul is the most kind, compassionate doctor I have known, and there have been many. He puts his cancer patients at ease and takes the fear out.  I have confidence in his treatment plan.	2
My name is Mitasha Brown Doctor Saul is the best doctor ever not only did he fix me but he humor you as well  he definitely is a great doctor and he knows what hes doing  May the good Lord continue to gide your hands Wish I could give you a 100 stars????????????????	2
His bedside manor is impeccable and he really eased my tension. I walked out of his office smiling and laughing! I have never had a doc do magic tricks and tell jokes to soothe nervous patients!! Overall, my experience with Dr.Saul and his assistant Mary was pleasant and thorough. I was very pleased with his practice.	2
"I met Dr Saul in 2009 when my Mother was diagnosed with cancer. Unfortunately my Mother
Passed 4 years after, but Dr. Saul was always there to support, explain and give his optimistic energy. He listened to me and delt with my calls and emails through the good and bad times and at the very end with my frantic emails. He is a very nice person and I think that my Mother’s life was extended due to his care.  I will never forget him because of his role during that part of our life. "	2
His integrity, confidence, bedside manner and concern  for my welfare is outstanding.  upon arrival for the first visit, I was seen within minutes. The office was organized and clean, the staff very friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable.  Exam room was Immaculate and comfortable.  The initial visit and subsequent visits were never rushed.  Dr. Saul thoroughly dealt with all of my concerns. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Howard Saul to Family and friends.	2

Dr. Saul is a very experienced, skilled and dedicated physician and surgeon.  He combines that with humility and a caring, attentive manner.  He takes the time to listen, puts you at ease, addresses concerns and explains everything.

I have been a patient of Dr. Saul since the 1990’s and he has my highest recommendation. 	2
I am so happy with my pre and post-operative care by Dr. Saul.  He is a wonderful, caring person who takes the time to make sure you understand everything about your condition & treatment.  I was confident entrusting my care to him.  He is so personable and likeable and I love the magic!  	2
I cannot say enough good things about this man. Not only does he treat me with kindness, understanding and skill, but also concerns himself with my husband feelings. We always leave his office with a complete understanding of the present issue and a sense of inner peace. He has treated me  for 2 cancer issues.  And with both he listens carefully.  Even before the first issue was resolved I had a feeling that I should live my life to the fullest and let him worry about the cancer.	0
Dr. Saul has been my doctor since 2002 and I felt so lucky to find him.  He is a very caring doctor with excellent communication skills.  A top doc in his field he helped me through a very trying time.   I would highly recommend him to my family and friends!  	2
Dr Saul is a fantastic doctor. He immediately puts his patients at ease. He thoroughly explains everything to ensure you and your loved ones understand the procedure. He has a great, caring manner and performs magic tricks. He called me back after my surgery due to a concern and spent time with me on the phone talking about my procedure and making sure I was ok.

Dr Saul did my surgery and he was excellent. He explained ed everything to me and his bedside manner was off the charts. I think that he is the best in his field and I am so happy that he is my doctor. I give him a 10.	2
" Seven years ago I called Dr. Saul's office.My appointment was scheduled as urgent.
The office is sunny and comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful in the office and on the phone.
Waiting time has been minimal,including the exam room.
Dr. Saul guided me to the correct surgery for me (arthroscopic).
Dr. Saul explained the the procedure not only to me but ,to my family so we would understand.
I have never felt like Dr.Saul or his staff were rushing me in any way.

"In my sixty five years of living I have experienced many Doctors. This man is a great human being. He is the reason my wife is alive and well today.We were referred to him in 2007 when my wife was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. He explained and demonstrated the robotic procedure he performed at our original consultation .He put our minds at ease at a time when we feared the worst. We have complete confidence in him and his staff. 
He is a people person and a Humanitarian of the highest caliber.
"	2
"Dr. Saul has been my gynecological oncologist since 2012.   His medical knowledge and expertise made me confident that I would beat the battle I was up against.   He is an advocate for you as the patient.    His caring attitude is ""magical"".   He is diligent in finding the medical treatment that will make you comfortable as the patient and confident in the results you need/will achieve.   "	2

"As someone who has never had any medical issues beyond the occasional bronchitis or sinus issues, to finding they have ovarian issues, and endometriosis, Dr. Saul was like a bright star in a dark sky.

Seriously, incredibly personable. I did not dread going to see him after my first visit. He was clear and concise in everything, as well as open to questions, addressing fears, etc. 

Exceptional bedside manners, and apparent skill in the OR, tucked into a real down to earth human being. 

<3"	2
"Doctor Saul was an absolute joy to meet and 'work with'.  He's charming, friendly and professional, and did a fantastic job of guiding us through a chaotic and frightening time.  Took as much time as we needed to explain what needed explaining in ways easy to understand, and of course the quality of medical care was as good as (so far as I can tell) is available to anyone, anywhere.

I feel we were very lucky to find him, and I'll always be thankful that we did.
"	2
I highly recommend Dr. Saul to anyone in need of gynocolgical care. He is kind and caring, and makes you feel very comfortable, and he has a wonderful bed side manner. God Bless him. 	2

Before, during and after my surgery, he was informative  and reassuring and supportive. He has a unique and magical bedside manner which helps to alleviate fears. I have recommended him to others in the past and will continue to do so.	2
Dr. Saul really put me at ease when I came to my first consultation for a hysterectomy.  His magic tricks were great, especially the day of surgery!  My surgery and recovery went very well.

He is not only a wonderful doctor, but a wonderful man.  His staff is exceptional as well.  They are extremely pleasant and always available.	2
"Before my first visit I was worried and anxious.  As Dr. Saul explained the test results and procedure in his relaxed and confident manner, I soon felt a calm trust in him.  I knew I was in good hands.  His caring attitude gave me a great comfort on the day of surgery.  The next day he visited me and kept me informed of the results.  Dr. Saul is a sensitive and attentive physician and I would highly recommend him to anyone.  
Thank you so much

"I praise God that Dr. Saul performed my wife Linda’s surgery.  From our first meeting, I had every trust in him.  After surgery I thanked him, but he said to give thanks to God.  I do thank God for giving this humble man the talent and skill to provide healing to those in need.
Thank you, Dr. Saul and bless you

I was referred to Dr.Saul by my GYN Dr. for a hysterectomy.  The news was upsetting, let alone having to go to a GYN/Onc. Dr. for the possibility of having cancer.  Dr. Saul put me at ease immediately with him calm and most pleasant demeanor.  He was thorough in explaining what would ensue, and gave me time for questions as we went along.  He even showed me a card trick after our session to put me even more at ease! After my surgery, his follow up was great and I would definitely recommend him.	2
Dr. Saul is a highly skilled physician with a stellar reputation. He will answer all your questions and put you at ease. I never felt rushed and the magic tricks are a real plus.

I'm very thankful for Dr. Bryant, he pays attention to every detail.
Answers all my concerns, despite the laguage barrier."	2
"Dr. Bryant is such a caring man.  He made me feel comfortable the moment he walked in the room.  It was very easy to talk to him.  He seemed interested in all I had to share.  This was going to be my first surgery ever and I knew I was in good hands.  Claire Sjobeck
"	2
Dr. Bryant, Marq & Melissa were so caring. I've had many medical issues through the years & by far, this was the best overall experience--with sharing knowledge, with being compassionate, with being attentive, with listening to my perspective. Dr. Bryant even checked in on me one evening at home after talking to my doctor. He shares his cell phone number with patients to be available if needed. One weekend day, I needed his advice & he helped. I couldn't recommend a more caring & expert team.	2
Dr. Bryant is an amazing doctor and I highly recommend him. He makes sure you understand the procedures and answers all of your questions. Dr. Bryant make sure I was comfortable before and after surgery. He is really one of the best doctor's I have ever had the privilege of going to. Highly recommended! 	2
"I would like to thank Melissa, Marq, Lisa and Nidia for the personal care and attention that they have given myself and my wife during a stressful time in our lives. They have made sure that all my needs have been met and each one of them has gone above and beyond their job duties to make sure we are well cared for and comfortable.
Dr. Bryant has been an amazing provider and I can not thank him enough for all that he has done for us. 
We lucked out when we found this team."	2
i am an oncologist myself and was very concerned when i found i had czncer. i know too much.  dr bryant and the entire staff have been fantastic.  of course, very professional, but their kindness and compassion have been over the top. Surgery was scheduled quickly and was an amazingly easy experience.  the doctor and staff have been available in case of a problem, but there were no problems.  There was minimal discomfort and a quick recovery. 	2
I am extremely grateful to Dr. Bryant and Marc for helping me through my medical journey.  I made numerous attempts to find a physician that would accept my difficult case including Volusia, Seminole and Orange County.  Dr.  Bryant and Marc were the first one to reassure me they would see my case until the end.  Although I was high risk and had a tumor that was larger than both of my children I birthed Dr. Bryant did not hesitate.   I felt immediate relief the day of surgery.	2
I have been working in the medical field for over 30 years as a biller/recovery analyst. I have to say that this office is pretty impressive. The staff are friendly and the doctor is very nice.  He came in listened to what I had to say and we made a plan.  A doctor that treats you as a person verses a number is a good quality to have...this doctor has it!  Would recommend him to anyone.	2
Dr.Bryant and his team are AWESOME! He and his team listen, are very kind, and attentive. Dr.Bryant is very knowledgeable in OBGyn matters.	2
Dr. Bryant is one of the most patient, friendly doctors I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He answered all my questions fully and I felt very secure and confident moving into my surgery. As for the surgery itself, it went perfect, and my recovery was phenomenally easy thanks to how efficient Dr. Bryant is. Of all my surgery incisions, I will have no visible scars, and everything healed perfectly even and fast. I would highly recommend Dr. Bryant to anyone who needs a gyn oncologist.	2
 I am so blessed to have been referred to Dr. Bryant.  He is the ultimate Professional.  His office staff and surgical team only heightened the positive experience.  Dr. Bryant truly cares about his patients and is willing to always go the extra mile to ensure your comfort.  There just are not enough words in the world, in any language, to acknowledge his support, caring and general love of his patients.  Beyond Outstanding!!!!!	2
"I had a Robotic surgery with Dr. Bryant I called him my Angel, everything was great! He was very professional and kind. After one week I Feel Fantastic!
I recommended 150% 

Recomiendo 150% a mi Doctor Bryant, excellente, muy profesional, muy humano.
Despues de una semana de cirugia robotica me siento super bien!
Muchas Gracias "	2
"Thank you for treat my Daughter. Reciba un saludo de parte de mi familia en Colombia y de parte mia aqui en Orlando
Gracias por tratar a mi hija con compasion, profesionalismo y respeto, me siento tranquila dejarla en sus manos Dr. Bryant.
Muchas Gracias 
Muy agradecida "	2
I will recommend Dr. Bryant to family and  friends. This experience was awesome from the office visits right through my surgery. The staff is always pleasant and professional Marc is awesome. They all make you feel comfortable in what can be sometimes a not so comfortable situation. Dr. Bryant is just remarkable in his knowledge as a Dr.. I  had so much confidence in him as a Dr. before my surgery which gave me great piece of mind.    	2
Best Dr. and staff ever! Thank you for everything!	2
I was referred to Dr. Bryant when I ended up in the hospital with a Bartholin's Abscess. Dr. Bryant did an excellent job with multiple surgeries to solve the issue and get me back to normal.  I am recovering and healing well! 	2
very likely.  dr. bryant is a great surgeon and person.  the office is awesome.  very,very efficient.  great experience from start to finish.  	2
Absolutely very kind friendly and understanding…slots of laughs	2
Dr. Bryant is a wonderful “captain!!!”  He and his staff did an excellent job with all aspects of my scary experience.  The support and compassion were beyond my expectations. If I had to go through something like this again, I would put my whole trust in Captain Bryant!  P.s.  I love that he was so easily assessable!!!  Big surprising PLUS!!!	2
My surgery went very well, he is an amazing doctor.,	2
"Dr. Reid treated me for 5 years after my GCT Ovarian Cancer diagnosis in 2011.  He came highly recommended from friends I had who were nurse anesthetists, as well as my Gyn.  Who better to recommend a specialist than those who work with Dr's in the operating rooms?!
He's a straight shooter, outlines all of your options, thoroughly explaining everything and gives you the facts.  He is a meticulous surgeon - perfectionist, which is what I appreciate in a Dr.  Always recommend him & appreciate him!"	2
I was rushed to Riverside Hospital by squad approx 3 yrs ago very ill. Thanks to Dr Reid and his staff as well as other medical professionals within the building and hospital I do believe they saved my live. I think the world of all of them. And I could not have asked for better treatment or compassion than I received from them. 	2
He explains everything very clearly. Very good at answering all your question. Never seems to hurry you. Calls you personally to talk and explain you results of test and  what treatment would  be done next.  Will call any time even weekends.  Just a total caring Doctor. 	2
Dr. Li is smart, skilled, patient, kind. In a difficult situation, you want a doctor like him.	2
Best of the best!!!	2
He is caring, extremely knowledgeable,  thorough, and kind. I wish all doctors were like him.	2
Dr. Li was caring, compassionate, and a wonderful communicator. That is over and above his great surgical skill.	2
I think he is a caring, competent, gave me complete confidence as a surgeon.  I have already referred Dr Li to a close friend.	2
This doctor is a combination of an amazing surgeon and a fantastic human being. He is the best a patient can get and I am blessed that he was my doctor	2
Dr. Li is incredible! He is so compassionate, gentle & kind. I was very nervous to get a procedure done especially because it was my first surgery in life and he did everything he could to not only make sure that I was comfortable but remind me that my feelings were valid. 	2
Dr Li was my oncologist 17 years ago along with Dr. Ronald Leuchter.  Dr. Li has the patience of a saint when it comes to answering medical questions.  He is skilled, kind and brings light to a dark journey.	2
Dr. Li has made it very easy for me to put my trust in his guidance and judgement.  I have been with him through three cancer occurrences, three cancer surgeries and a lot of chemo.  He gives much more to his patients then anyone could imagine!  My family and I are truly grateful to Dr. Li and his staff! 	2
Dr Li is one of the best doctors I’ve had! I’m so thankful that I was referred to him for my surgery and am forever grateful for us thoroughness and kindness. Because of Dr Li I feel like a new person. 	2
Amazing If I could give him 100 stars I would!	2
"Dr. Li is first of all very personable and a lovely man.  I showed up very frightened about my health and his calm, friendly demeanor immediately put me at ease.  He kept close eye contact the entire time, and when I told him I was afraid, he leaned in and said, ""Look at me; this is not how you're going to die.""  I kept those reassuring words close to me throughout scary symptoms and diagnostic tests and they greatly helped carry me through.  Dr. Li is wonderful."	2
There are not enough stars to rate Dr. Li and his team! I couldn’t be happier with the success I had with my surgery.. 	2
"Truly a very caring Dr.
Really cares ????
Endearing 
Dr.Li knows his work he has made sure that he was with me all the way when I had my hysterectomy ??
Thank you Dr.Li
Gladys VanVarenberg "	2
My experience with Dr. Li was the best I could’ve hoped for. I am grateful and feel extremely blessed to have been referred to him. He is EXCELLENT at his job and he is so patient and caring. He spent hours explaining things to us. Thank you, Dr. Li!! You saved my life. 	2
Dr. Li did my hysterectomy and bilateral salingo oophorectomy. I’m BRCA1 positive and I did it as a prevebtative measure.  In our consultation, Dr. Li was so friendly and warm and patient with me (I had a lot of questions) and I just loved him. About a week before surgery I panicked, and he talked me off the ledge and reassured me about everything. The surgery went great, and he was mindful of the aesthetics with my scars and made me feel totally at ease pre-op. Can’t recommend him enough!!	2
"I am so grateful to have met Dr. Li. He is not only precise ,attentive, investigative and articulate, but also sensitive , respectful , mature and empathetic. He has a great team as well. 
"	2
I was impressed with how much time Dr. Li took with me going over my scans and explaining the procedure I had. It went according to plan and I am recovering at home. His skill and bed-side manner are a wonderful combination. 	2
Superb surgeon, personable and knowledgeable.  Outstanding combination! The very best. Cedars Is so fortunate to have him there.	2
Dr. Li is one of the best doctors I’ve ever met.  Hands down.  He is very compassionate, kind and puts your mind completely at ease the moment you speak with him.  I left every time I had an appointment feeling like I was in great hands.  Not to mention, his entire staff— all the nurses who helped out during my surgery were very kind as well.  I’m very grateful my doctor referred me to him.	2
"This man is compassionate, accurate, thorough, kind, holistic and generous with his time. There are no words to describe our partnership in my wellness campaign. He played ball and we won. He goes above and beyond common care with diligence and preparation. 

If you must have cancer, have it with him."	2
Excellent and caring physician. 	2
He is excellent he is trustworthy, very friendly answers all questions explains everything to you fully I could not ever find a better Dr	2
"Dr. James Kendrick, IV is sensitive, thoughtful, compassionate, understanding, and very personable.
He is professional and exercises wisdom, patience, and discretion when dealing with patients making sure needs and concerns are addressed and is willing to listen and include them as a part of the decision making process.  I highly recommend him.”"	2
Excellent!	2
Dr. Kendrick is very professional, knowledgeable and compassionate and understanding in discussing his patient's issues.  I would highly recommend him to others, as he is absolutely wonderful!!!!	2
Dr. Kendrick was compassionate, attentive and informative. In a trying time where options are limited, he explained the outcomes and provided us hope. We thank God for putting us in the hands of such an amazing surgeon and individual. 	2
Dr. Kendrick is my most favorite doctir ever in my 68 years of life. He is an extremely skilled doctor with compassion and kindnesss for all his patients. He saved my life in July of 2009, stage 3+ ovarian cancer. Most other doctors would not have tried to operate. My family and I are eternally grateful to Dr. Kendrick and God for giving us more time together here on earth. If you are looking for the best doctor, you just found him. God bless you and your family Dr. Kendrick!	2
Dr Kendrick is professional, knowledgeable , courteous and well organized. He gets to the point without seeming rushed. He allocates the appropriate staff resources for the appointment and they all worked as a team. Dr Kendrick treated me with respect and was sympathetic to my discomfort. Dr. Kendrick clearly explained his impressions and recommended next steps. Asked if I had questions and provided answers. I feel fortunate to have found Dr. Kendrick to address my condition. I trust him.	2
"
""At all times I am guided by the values ??of compassion, mercy and respect for the dignity of each patient, these are your words.
because they had no comparison with my sister who left a paraplegic girl alone because she explained it to me because I do not find an explanation for this great mistake and so much evil that exists in their lives, it is not fair and I can not do anything because she is already dead but there is a god who sees everything and does justice"	1
Excellent all, before during and after my  Robotic Hystectomy surgery. I highly recommend them. Thank you very much Dr.Kendick and his entire professional team.	2
Dr Kendrick has treated my mother for 2 plus years.  We first met him after a Stage 4 ovarian cancer diagnosis and he helped us understand what we were facing and how to proceed.  He's been an extremely compassionate, kind and very competent physician and surgeon.  He's taken a very difficult road and made it one that is easier to travel.  We owe all the special moments we've shared since her diagnosis to him and his excellent care.  If you are facing a similar diagnosis, choose Dr. Kendrick.  	2
He did my cone biopsy in 2010. He was the most knowledgeable and caring. He is definitely the best!	2
"Dr. Shahabi is a women who care for people, she have a gifts, that being use to save people life, Excellent, bedside matter.  I thank God for her and I never will forget how she help me!!! 

I worked a Northwestern Medicine  for 15th year this November, I hear and watch on tv about their  doctor, but I could truly witness to the wonderful, caring doctor's and I give them a million stars to the staff!!!!!!!!!!!"	2
I literally couldn’t give an example of a more caring and empathetic physican.  She is my mother’s oncologist and her care is impeccable.  She calles at 8pm at night, visits her in the hospital and 9pm on a Saturday, she remembers family members names and recent vacations.  She is an exceptionally bright woman and talented physican, should you get the opportunity to work with her you should leap at the chance.	2
Not only did Dr. Shahabi do a great job medically, she has outstanding people skills and bedside manner.  Can't recommend her highly enough.  Get her opinion if you need this type of help.	2
"Dr Shahabi treated me during a time in my life when I thought I wouldn't survive. She was instrumental in saving my life!! Thank you so much. 
"	2
Dr Field is a friendly, excellent physician with great bedside manner. Entire staff is pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient. As was the staff at the out patient surgery center. I won't hesitate to use him for all my family's future orthopedic needs.	2
I had a good experience with Dr. Spain.  He was very thorough and friendly!  I’d use him again!	2
Very knowledgeable about my issue. Answered all my questions. Had a sense of humor, which I appreciated. 	2
Had a procedure done. Very quick and painless. In and out.	2
Dr. Schwab is a most competent physician with great knowledge and skills.  His explanations, bedside manners and punctuality are difficult to find.	2
"Dr.Schwab is the BEST!!!.Extremely caring he replaced both of my knees one in 2001 and tbe other in 2003.I wouldn't have any other surgeon do my knees but DR.Schwab!!! Very caring and understanding DR.!! The best bedside manners! Thank you Dr.Schwab for all you have done for me!!! Kimberly Carter
"	2
I was impressed by Dr Schwab's thoroughness and willingness to spend time explaining everything carefully and answer all questions . He is one of the nicest doctors/people I've met, a great bedside manner. I would recommend him to everyone.	2
Excellent doctor.  Bedside manner, empathy, knowledge  and personality. 	2
This was my 1st visit and he was very responsive to my questions and listened to my concerns! I will definitely be back to see him in the future 	2
Great - he listens and takes every comment seriously.  This was my second appointment and would definitely recommend him to others.	2
I have seen Dr. Clem three times in the past two months.  He is always on time, very curtious, and patient with his explanations of procedures.	2
She is one of the most amazing doctors I've ever had, she is very patient and has a great bedside manner. I would definitely recommend her! 	2
She is very personal and caring. I had DE querveins  on my wrist, surgery went great, also had steroid shots in a tendon in thumb joint. That work amazing. Highly suggest her :)	2
Dr Pfeifer is a very nice man. He listens to my concerns and tries to find ways to help.  	2
Dr. Pfeiffer is awesome. He really helped me get back to my normal life again.	2
Professionalism	2
Feel very confident and optimistic with recommended treatment.	2
Dr. Pfeifer was great!  He took the time to examine me thoroughly & listened to my concerns.  He was straightforward & informative & professional!	2
Dr. Pfeifer is a great doctor.  He is very caring and listens.  HE takes the time to listen.  Highly recommend	2
Pleasant, efficient, competent staff - Drs, nurses, receptionists - everyone	2
Awesome staff - friendly and helpful!	2
Thanks go to Dr. R.P. + Nurse Donna for their excellent care.	2
Great doctor.  Very nice to work with.	2
Everyone that I have come in contact with are awesome.  Thank you!	2
Very satisfied! Nice staff!!	2
"Dr Pfeifer is great. I have DJD and needed pain injection at C7 (right arm is effected).  Initial consult was fine and Ryan is super friendly and has great situational awareness. I was confident with his diagnosis and treatment plan. 
The outpatient procedure could not have been done ANY better. His team (Rothman Inst) are nice, efficient and all around caring. 
Time will tell if the injection fixed my problem but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr Ryan Pfeifer. 
Thanks to everyone on that team! God bless. "	2
Dr. Pfeiffer was excellent.  Explained everything!	2
Overall comfortable experience.  Great staff and doctor.  Thank you!	2
Very friendly and helpful!	2
Dr. Pfeiffer was extremely patient, thorough and clear in his explanations. Spent all the time I needed. Great experience	2
I feel so much better after seeing Dr. Pfeifer and having a simple procedure.	2
Feeling grateful for the care that Rothman and Dr. Pfeifer provided me.  Blessed to have come this way.  God is good!	2
Been very  happy with Dr. Pfeifer, the nurses and treatment so far.	2
It was a good experience with Dr. Pfeifer and the rehab staff at Rothman Northeast Phila	2
Dr. Pfeifer and his staff were very nice.  The only thing wrong is that I did not come sooner!	0
First visit wasn't a good impression. I felt I was not being taken seriously. 	0
Dr pfeifer misdiagnosed my spine condition. Told me i wasn't a surgical candidate and referred me to pain management to be on pills the rest of my life. I got a second opinion and i do need surgery.  Waste of time and money.	0
Dr. pfeifer is very knowledgeable in his field and he bed side manner is excellent. I felt he was very honest and I would trust him with my loved ones.	2
He is not a bad physician, he seems to know his speciality very well.    However, he is rude in the sense that does not have good tactics with his patients.  Perhaps he is tired after so many years of practice.  	0
The old mommy in the front desk it's the most horrific thing in this office place it's a museum just like the Dr. That practice there never go back there they have to retired since 50 years ago!!!	0
I loved my visit with Dr.Ramirez as soon as I told him the symptoms I was having he did a few tests and gave me a diagnosis. He prescribed some medications and physical therapy and I am much improved. His office staff makes you feel at home. 	2
Never never go there worse place. RUDE. I left and will never go back.	0
This office is nasty. The meanest woman I have ever met. She is scary looking. I am writing this in the office I jaust had to. Very dirty with boxes for bugs on the floor. doctor is very old I will never come agian do NOT RECCOMMEND	0
Disgusting office cockaroaches on the floor I killed one   We left dont Do not go	0
HORRIBLE!!! The older lady at the front desk is the rudest person I met in long time. the docter is also rude and old. He cant hear me or he didnt listen to what I said. He gave me an injection and when I saw the needle I said I didnt want it. I dont think he can see well he kept skwinting his eye.A friend told me that their was a young doctor in the office that was good but they said they did not know where he was. I felt i was ignored the entire time i was there. never never go there	0
"Doctor is unsympathetic to patients' health. He exudes an air of coldness. He seems jaded by years of experience. 

I went in with workman's comp injury; I explained that I was still feeling pain. I tried to describe to him the repetitive & enormous amount of heavy lifting my job requires; my words went in 1 ear & out the other. He fully cleared me to return to work!  I ended up injuring the same body part again.  

In my opinion, he has to be biased, in favor of employer's interests. 

"	0
I had two appointments  with him. Too bad he cant hear too well. I was injured at work i have a herniated disc and sciatica. Im still in so much pain daily since june 19, 2015 and i told this doc that i had numbness and tingling in my lege he ignored  these syptoms. He gave me 2 spinal injections i told him they did not relieve pain he ignored me. Since then ive seen 2 docs and they keep reviewing dr ramirez notes instead of listening to me im in so much pain still. This doc should retire	0
"I had shoulder pain, made an appointment with Dr. Unis. Doctors Staff is very accommodating gave me an immediate appoitment and a only a five minute wait! He even greeted his patients in the waiting room, I loved that he is down to earth! He is the most pleasant Doctor with manners and a sense of humor.
 He listens and is concerned. He is through with examination, explains what is wrong, and treatment plan, best for me.  
I am glad I choose Dr. Unis he is  outstanding! 
His other reviews 5 stars"	2
I was a patient of his for 41 years after a car accident at work and the care and advice he gave me was outstanding . I idid have my knee replaced in Florida where I live now but his care and advice were the best ! Anne Kane	2
I am very pleased with the care Dr. Unis provides. 	2
I waited in the office for about an hour before threatening to leave. Then I was ushered in. The doctor was very intelligent however the communication in the office is poor. The people who ordered my test asked me what test I needed and when I didn’t know the test name they had to leave and go reconfirm with the doctor. Like what? They also almost allowed me to leave without doing a test i needed. I had to remind them of that test. I also felt like i kept clarifying information because when it was read back to me it was incorrect. It scared me enough to not want to go back. I simply appreciate the referral to a specialist who can help me.	0
This appt should have been canceled.	0
Terrible experience. The specific thing i listed in Zocdoc about addressing was not able to be addressed there. I was not able to get prescribed my medication and then was told i needed to transfer old records. I called my old doctor this morning to transfer records and then when i called Dr. hussain’s office they said “the fax person isn’t in today so we can’t check until tmrw”. but i had told the doctor i had to leave for a trip so it was a timely issue. The “fax person” not being in is a ridiculous reason for a delay in medical records transferring. Waste of an appt.	0
The medical clinic is very poorly run. It took them months to get me my standard blood work results back. They asked me to come back in to redo some tests, but when I reached the office they had no idea why I was there. After they sorted that out and my blood was drawn, it was 3 weeks before I learned that they didn’t even rerun the tests they were supposed to. I will not be returning to this clinic and would highly recommend looking elsewhere for your primary care needs.	0
staff are bad at following up.	0
The doctor seemed professional but her front staff were not. They spelled my name wrong on the charts, did not seem to care about cleanliness, and opened the door during my exam to talk to someone else (not related to my appointment). Not a great facility overall.	0
To be honest I won’t be returning here after my 2 week check back and blood results.	0
I had an irregularity on a test result and my doctor didn't notice or tell me for an entire year. I will never go back here.	0
This clinic always makes me wait over 45 minutes to be seen for 5 minutes. They have no respect for their patients’ time.	0
Nice enough bedside manner, but she definitely looked at her laptop more than she did at me. I've since moved onto a new GP.	0
Very disorganized staff and office. I like Dr Shirin but this is an amateur run practice.	0
i have a pretty minor issue, but dr. peters took the time to answer all my questions and addressed my concerns	1
The doctor was rude and unhelpful. Did not seem to care about my condition at all.	0
Poor experience, lost labs and never received apology or results.	0
Almost everything was done by her nurse, doctor paid little attention to me.	0
It will be the last time. Wait is too long. Completely disorganized.	0
The office rescheduled my appointment two times and were not organized.	0
The nurses working there do not seem quite professional.	0
"My actual visit went well. Before, being seen however was a MESS! Their phone line wasn't working, well, ""No one was on phones"" was what i was told in regards to why I could reach anyone on the phone. I was misinformed about proper address So i had to shuffle fm 79th to 57th. Overall annoying."	0
Overall disorganized experience and very very slow. I checked in at 8:20 AM and didn’t see a doctor until after 9:15AM. I waited to see the doctor and no one working in the office seemed to be preoccupied with anything. The nurses who saw me before the doctor seemed very inexperienced. The office itself is very old. Everyone was nice but the overall experience was very poorly managed and extremely delayed and slow. I would not recommend this doctors office.	0
"Dr. Peters' office is unreliable. They lost my test results, and then said that ""we might have not done the right test"" for a time-sensitive and potentially life-threatening issue. After they were so unhelpful and unresponsive about this, I ended up having to go to another doctor to be treated, and they were pretty appalled by the incompetency of this practice. I would never recommend Dr. Peters as a primary care provider"	0
I’m kind of done with this MD and her incompetent staff and shady. billing practices. Five years and I’m looking for a primary doctor that values their patients not just to generate revenue.	0
Scam doctor! Stay away!	0
The first appointment was fine, except I felt like the doctor wasn't listening to me. The second appointment I had to wait about 2 hours and it was a follow-up. I had a third scheduled and ended up stuck at home due to a plumbing problem, for which the office wanted to charge me a fine. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.	0
Very transactional. Receptionist was extremely unprofessional and did not properly check my insurance information, also played loud music.	0
I had a very disappointing experience at Dr. Shrin Peters' office. For my first appointment, she did not see me	0
Dealing with this office was terrible. I was assured that one of the vaccines that I received would be reimbursable through my insurance, but that I would need to pay out of pocket. It then took about six weeks and numerous phone calls to get the office to submit the claim to my insurance company and over four and a half months and at least ten more phone calls to get the doctor's office to reimburse me (two and a half months after the insurance company paid out the claim).	0
Dr. Peters was 30 minutes late for my appointment, not because she was running late with another patient but because she'd gone out for to get coffee. When she did see me, not a word of apology was offered.	0
I have never felt the need to post a negative review for anything but I felt the need to warn whoever might see this - STAY AWAY FROM THIS OFFICE. They are so unprofessional and such a mess!!! I am switching immediately. I wish I would have known sooner. DO NOT GO!	0
I am going to tell you the truth about this experience. This is an unethical group of people. I told them I was in for a routine yearly exam. They ran a battery of in office tests and labs that I did not ask for or need. I now owe hundreds of dollars. Please BEWARE.	0
Dr. Peters was professional but not very warm or friendly. I was told that I would be called with my lab results a week after my appointment, however I never received a call and found it very difficult to get anyone on the phone when I called the office. I found out months later that I was never informed of negative test results that I should have been, as the receptionist had forgotten to call me. I would not recommend this Dr. and will most likely not see her again.	0
Doctors are good, but the staff there is extremely unhelpful. My prescription that I had been taking for 5 years suddenly required doctor authorization (which requires the doctor to make ONE phone call), and it's now taking over a week to get the problem sorted out.	0
The staff is rude and unorganized. They should be dressed in scrubs instead of blending in with the patients. It once too like 3 weeks to get my medical record faxed to my neurologist. It's a mess.	0
This office is manipulative and corrupt. They basically want to steal your money and do everything they can including threatening to charge you if you do not comply with their scams. It is unethical and borderline illegal. do not go here and find an office that treats you like a patient and not a dollar sign.	0
This place is so bad. Everything is a mess, and it's so disorganized there. I can't believe I stayed there as long as I did. It feels like someone's basement apartment that has kids - papers, equipment, everything strewn about on the floor. It's impossible to reach anyone on the phone there, and impossible to book an appointment within a reasonable time.	0
She didn't listen to me, didn't seem to care about anything I was telling her, didn't answer any of my questions, just told me to get a blood test, then didn't tell me the results of the blood test. Made me feel awful.	0
Office was dirty and very unorganized. Started examining me without even realizing why I was there. Staff yelling across to one another and papers flying everywhere. Did not trust what was going on and did not feel sanitary. Doctor was fine but not very friendly and made me a little uncomfortable.	0
Definitely tried to upsell other services which seemed to be of a dubious efficacy. Gave me really confusing information about whether I should breastfeed while taking a medication--directly contradicting the literature she also emailed me that said there was no risk of using it. I would not go to this doctor again if I was breastfeeding because her email about side effects was a source of anxiety when, actually, the official information she sent me said that there was no risk. I took the medicine and was fine, by the way.	0
I thought Shirin Peters was pretty impersonal. My visit with her made me realize that healthcare is about money not necessarily quality of care. It seemed like she was constantly trying to upsell me on things that I didn't need. I also scheduled a physical 1 week later and it was like I had never been there before. She asked the same questions and had no recollection of my previous visit.	0
Dr. Peters seemed very rushed and didn't have time for my questions. She was brusk and came off judgmental and I would not recommend her to my friends.	0
Didn't seem interested. Was staring at her laptop most of the appointment. Did not think to offer any solutions that could help me without me asking.	0
Horrible doctor! Absolutely horrible. I went in to see her and there was no follow up. I will never return to this office ever again.	0
I was not pleased with my visit to see Dr. Peters. I had to wait a rather long time to be seen for a very quick appointment. Dr. Peters rushed through my apt and then said that she would call in a prescription for me and never did. I called her office several times and left several messages and never got a response. The visit was a total waste of time and I am concerned that she never even ran the tests that she said she would run!	0
I'm still sitting in the doctors office. It's 1 pm. My appointment was originally scheduled for 9am and at 8:30, I got a phone call asking me to come in later because I would be waiting a long time if I came in when I was supposed to. I came in at 10:50, for my rescheduled visit at 11 to fill out paperwork. It took an hour and a half before I even saw Dr Peters. I was with her for under 10 minutes and she told me she wanted me to see a different doctor, who was a skin specialist. He was at lunch and supposed to be back by 12:30. Needless to say, he hasn't come back and I am still waiting. This is the most unprofessional office I have been in in quite sometime. While dr peters seems like a nice person, that does not make up for the fact that this office seems to be run by a slew of completely incompetent people. I will not be returning.	0
"They did not call me with my test results until two weeks after they had received them. It would have been nice to know the test results when they got them. When they called me, they did not want to send me the real test results. Only sent me a sentence saying ""probable"" illnesses. Not helpful at all. Do not recommend."	0
I thought it was terribly disorganized and unprofessional. While everyone was friendly, I was completely in the dark the whole visit wondering what was going on, who was involved and what would happen next. There seemed to be a lot of people learning but no one seemed totally confident in what they were doing. During my allergy test there were constant knocks on the door and people coming in and out of the room while I was laying there half-clothed. It was a very anxiety provoking experience.	0
I've been to Dr. Peters a few times over the past few months. The office has billed me incorrectly every. single. time. Dr. Peters is not the most personable, comes off as cold and too busy to listen that closely. Not an awful experience, but certainly not conducive to the kind of relationship I want with my primary care doctor.	0
Although I had an appointment, my wait time was over 30 minutes. Not only that, but I did not feel like I was thoroughly checked for my physical. I will not see Dr. Peters again.	0
I thought Dr. Peters was very nice, but her office is poorly managed. I received abnormal pap results and was not able to speak with a competent medical professional about the results. Instead, I was referred to a specialist that was outside of my insurance network. It was a situation that was poorly handled. I will not, unfortunately, be returning to this office.	0
probably won't be coming back to Dr. Peters. While she was perfectly nice, she didn't examine me at all during my visit. After I described my problem, she simply lined up an allergy panel and wrote out some prescriptions. After the allergy panel, nobody followed to talk to me about the results and I had to explicitly request a copy. I'm still unclear what the purpose of the panel was.	0
Dr. Peters is a little bit of a weird doctor. She sits at her desk and didn't really examine me during my physical. Everything was left to the nurses, which is fine but it seems a little abnormal for a doctor to be so hands-off. She did go over my test results very thoroughly but did send me for a lot of unnecessary lab work.	0
Handled a big medical scare VERY carelessly and unprofessionally, and it proved almost impossible to follow up with her without booking an appointment. Created a lot of needless anxiety during a hard time for me anyway.	0
It seemed like I was in someone's apartment rather than a doctor's office. Too, the office was not open when I arrived and she was running late. It all felt very unprofessional.	0
Made me feel very uncomfortable. Referred me to another doctor without investigating my symptoms or potential causes for my symptoms. Often felt like I was being accused of claiming false symptoms when I was not.	0
"I went for a general consultation and the ""dermatologist"" didn't even examine my skin. Dr. Peters just said she would referred me to another doctor and never even sent me that information either. When I called back for the referred doctors info I was told I would be called back with that information and never heard back from anyone."	0
I have decided to switch to a different primary care general physician. I have found Dr. Peter's office to be consistently unprofessional. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first two times, but after going there three times and experiencing some amount of incompetence every single time (whether while doing the labs, or problems with billing, or not the best advice) I have had enough. While Dr. Peters is very friendly, I do not recommend her office. She has a lot to learn and her practice has a lot of growing to do in terms of professionalism.	0
Unfortunately Dr Peters staff is completely incompetent. The front desk is ok except I've had some issues with them in receiving extra bills for my routine procedures. The PAs never seem to know what they're doing. I'm asked every visit (even if I was just there two weeks prior) if I still have my moles and allergies. Last time I checked those things don't change overnight. They're also never prepared for procedures and the rooms are incredibly small, cluttered and uncomfortable.	0
Very unprofessional staff, I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. I had to chase them for a blood test result because the nurse practitioner is lazy to put on the system.	0
This place was so awful and extremely disorganized. It seemed like even the nurses were just winging it. I was 0% satisfied with my visit. The front desk women were really rude and had a bad attitude. And the nurses were extremely judgmental. This place also wasn’t very clean , which made me nervous.	0
They’ll charge your card as much as possible without running completely through insurance. Don’t leave a card on file to be safe	0
Staff incapable of handling a simple situation, short staffed, terrible experiences and I tried twice!	0
This doctor sent me home violently ill and said to see a gastroenterologist on Monday, which would have been a 3 day wait. I was at the ER the day after he sent me home. Terrible experience.	0
The wait time was totally unacceptable.	0
poor bedside manner.	0
Felt pretty rushed. I ended up getting the care I needed but I didn't get the opportunity to ask questions. I probably wouldn't use him as my PCP.	0
Staff is rude and pushy. They demanded documents not requested initially, despite having no need or legal requirement for said documentation. Many medical students in office, which slows down treatment times.	0
I see him because of his location but be ready to wait. He is always running an hour behind.	1
Longest wait ever. Absolutely ridiculous. Took nearly 2 hours to get in and out.	0
The doctor discriminates against government employees using government insurance. There was no compassion and worse he didn’t remember my medical issue and never asked about it even though I am headed into surgery soon.	0
Felix was extremly unprofessional. His assistant who was helping him was unorganized and not trained properly for her job, not to mention she was coughing and sneezing the whole time without covering her mouth. It is a mortifying experience and will likely never use zocdoc again due to this.	0
Felt very rushed throughout visit, the Dr gave short and non-satisfactory answers. My primary reason for the visit was I wanted labs done to confirm an infection -- the office never got back to me after the labs were completed after 3+ weeks.	0
The staff was extremely unprofessional. Did ECG 9 times and couldn’t get the correct result. Keep retapping everything and the room was really cold. The worst thing is the nurse has terrible personal hygiene issue. Doctor Chien was very nice and professional. However I would not do go back.	0
This is the worst doctor visit I ever had.	0
He is disrespectful. And mean! It's like a fake office .. He is probably collecting insurance money! After I get my results! I'm never going back there again!! And I don't recommend anyone going there!	0
I have seen many doctors. But this had to my worst experience seeing a doctor.	0
She was dismissive and unclear with some scary news. When I sought clarification she wasn't very respectful. It was a horrible experience. This was after waiting over two hours for my appointment.	0
This was the worst experience I’ve ever had at a doctor. After waiting over 90minutes to be seen, the doctor constantly interrupted me and tried to force me into several expensive and completely unnecessary. It was a complete waste of my time and I will now need to go to another doctor.	0
She legitimately made me cry because she was so rude. I asked her to make sure she filled out the medical release form for my surgery that I am having next week and she asked me if I was questioning her competence, grabbed the papers from me, threw them on her desk. Was completely unapologetic I would never recommend her to anyone	0
Incredibly unhelpful. Left feeling worse than I did when I walked in. And the exam room I was in smelled like an elementary school cafeteria, which was terrible.	0
Pretty bad in terms of wait-time, but the reception staff is excellent! Nice and clean office too. The real problem is that this practice is (like other reviews say) just another billing factory. I got called back for a follow-up for test results that were already posted online; doctor refused to take a quick call over the phone to tell me what was up. Wasted my time and money by asking me to come back in.	0
I never write reviews but because I was treated very disrespectful and nasty, I need to warn others.	0
I was incredibly dissatisfied with my experience. I had made an appointment in the early morning to be sure that I would make it to work on time, and the Doctor made me wait over an hour.	0
I've never seen a doctor with a worse bedside manner. Borderline rude, dismissive and overall, unhelpful. Amazed she has a job at such a busy and convenient practice. Reception staff was amazing.	0
The waits have been ridiculous. I've been referred to the wrong doctors and the waits are always at least an hour.	0
I’m never coming back here! She’s highly disorganized (clearly) and doesn’t seem to care about doctor patient confidentiality! I will be reporting this! ALSO NOTE: this entire office is highly disorganized. The three times I was there, the nurses kept calling me in rooms to take my stats when they were already done. Chaos is everywhere!	0
Dr. Coghill had a two hour wait, didn't help with anything I came there for, only referred me to specialists. It was a waste of time.	0
My experience with Dr Coghill was probably the worst I have ever had with any doctor. She displayed no interest in my symptoms, or hypotheses about what might be wrong, instead she rushed me out of the room and ordered tests and referrals. It seems like she is only interested in pushing patients through to drive billings. Very sad and I am still on the search for a new PCP.	0
Wasn’t thorough at all. Was very dissatisfied with my visit.	0
Avoid. This woman is truly unprofessional, condescending, and rude. The worst doctor’s appointment of my life. Will never return. Save yourselves don’t book.	0
Unfortunately, I waited 1.5 hours to see the doctor and did not connect with Dr. Coghill in any way. Her explanations were unclear and her demeanor was puzzling. Without exaggeration, it was lowest quality doctor’s visit I’ve ever experienced.	0
Dr. Cahill was hurried, dismissive and despite never having seen me as a patient and knowing this was my first checkup in +5 years , only allocated 20 minutes for my visit.	0
I waited two hours for a 5 minute procedure. I saw the doctor for less than 30 seconds. I wont be going back to this office.	0
Most bizarre and horrible experience ever.	0
This is the most unprofessional office I’ve ever been to. Terrible unprofessional office. Would not recommend.	0
This was the worst PCP I have ever seen in my life. The office screams unprofessional.	0
Not coming back. Went twice, had to pay right away, long wait, referred to specialist and then had to pay again, bad communication with specialists and doctor. Waste of time.	0
THIS WOMAN IS A SOCIOPATH AND A SCAMMER WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT RUNNING TESTS ON HER MACHINES TO MAKE MONEY FROM YOUR INSURANCE. SHE ALSO WILL TAUNT YOU, REFUSE TO PRESCRIBE YOU AN ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT FOR THE BURN YOU CAME IN WITH, AND WILL GENERALLY TREAT YOU LIKE GARBAGE. ABSOLUTELY VILE. SHE SHOULD BE EXPOSED.	0
She wouldn't look me in tge eyes when she spoke to mw and when she did speak she was cold and uncaring.	0
She is the worst Doctor of all time. Don't ever go!!!!!	0
Can you call her a doctor? Not professional and so rude	0
She was very rude! Hopefully if ill you have another option!	0
Worst doctor's experience I've ever had, bar none. I wouldn't recommend this doctor to anyone.	0
The doctor was very aloof and unsympathetic. She almost made me feel bad about myself for being ill.	0
The office was very unhygienic, which is not something you want in a doctor’s office. Dr. Chan herself had a terrible bedside manner and was very unprofessional. I’ve actually never had a doctor be so rude to me before. It was shocking.	0
Office assistants are very unprofessional. They are not listening not care about patient's concerns/questions. Their manners make me feel uncomfortable for the entire appointment and follow-up conversation.	0
Don’t waste your money. It was a waste of my copayment. WASTE OF MONEY and TIME!	0
Extremely unprofessional office. I was left waiting alone for 30+ minutes past my appointment time before even being given paperwork. The office was dimly lit and very uninviting. Doctor seemed very brash and confused by my presence. Will not return.	0
Office manager/assistant is grossly unprofessional and disorganized, treated me quite rudely. I would not recommend this doctor or his office unless you want to be treated poorly and callously.	0
I would not recommend this doctor to my worst enemy. Sorry but this is one doctor I would never recommend !	0
The most humiliating experience I've ever had with a doctor.	0
He was rude, abrupt and quick to get me out of his office.	0
pretentious, rude, and horrible bedside manor.	0
I'm not sure what others see in this doctor, but I had an absolutely terrible experience. Don't go here if you're looking for an annual physical. Maybe he's a great doctor for others, but I unfortunately had a very negative experience here.	0
Quality of care is poor, demeanor is unprofessional, low quality feedback with regard to my health concerns.	0
Doctor believes in money making machine. He will recommend you everything that will let you pay more and more until you are fed up. The result will not even fixed the issue.	0
Completely unprofessional, did not address any of my symptoms. Waste of time.	0
Eric is just concerned about money!!!!! He has no interest in his patients. He especially did not follow my referring doctors instructions for blood tests. He did half the tests and still wanted me to pay for him to correct his own mistake!!!!! WARNING STAY AWAY.	0
Despite the short wait time, Dr. Kirschner has a terrible bedside manner. I have no desire to return to Dr. Kirschner's care.	0
Quite a bad experience here: waited for over 30 minutes in the room, staff were rude and unprofessional (swearing at each other in the hallway), doctor saw me for less than 5 minutes, I had one item I wanted to talk about that he dismissed altogether, no one called or emailed me to give me my results or even told me how to receive them, overall would not recommend at all.	0
This office is very sterile and uncomfortable, but they get you in and out. I would not recommend if you want to find a doctor that gets to know you, and builds a relationship with you. I went in for an annual physical and found it to be unpleasant.	0
More interested in squeezing money out of your insurance than helping you.	0
"The receptionist was awfully rude. I asked her questions about my co-payment and she kept yelling at me ""check your insurance card!!!!"" even after I told her that there is no such information on my card and this is why I am asking you to check. She wouldn't bother but just yelled ""then check your insurance document"". I would not recommend anybody to deal with this mess."	0
He practically rushed me out of his office and seemed to not be concerned about patients. Same is true about most doctors here at this clinic. They only care about the money.	0
Dr. Drullinsky barely spent anytime with me and I felt very rushed. He over billed me for more than one visit and his office was a nightmare to deal with when I tried to resolve it. Stay AWAY!!	0
If you want a doctor who can talk to you and make it look like your health matters, stay away from him.	0
Think twice when booking an appointment here. The staff is completely rude and they fight with each other. The doctor doesn't really care why you are visiting. It'll be the quickest appointment in your life. Avoid at all cost!!	0
Awful. He offered no help and sent me away in less than a minute.	0
I am in discomfort awaiting help and information. Reception staff is unwelcoming, unhelpful, and uncommunicative.	0
Horrible! This is just a horrible medical center. The receptionist is incredibly rude.	0
I can't recommend him at all. He's always in a hurry; not very thorough. And impatient.	0
I would not recommend this doctor whatsoever. This is the second time I've seen him. The appointment was extremely rushed and none of my questions were answered. His response to every single one of them was that I should see a specialist, when my general doctors had answered all of these questions in the past. Not a good experience!	0
"His staff was extremely unprofessional and didn't want to provide me with my lab results; said everyone was ""too busy."""	0
I waited over an hour for an annual physical in a room with bunch of weirdo listening loud music. The staff didn’t care. The doctor spent 5 mins tops, didn’t answer to some of the issues I shared and didn’t follow up on my test results. Very disappointed.	0
It was terrible. Doctor/nurse/receptionist all had minimal interpersonal skills. I waited 55 minutes for a TDAP and flu shot. Doctor was literally in my room for less than 30 seconds total. I will never go back here and will not recommend this practice to anyone else.	0
Waste of time and money.	0
wrote incorrect prescription, made me wait at least 30-60 minutes longer than needed for simple results, will NEVER see this physician again and unfavorably recommended to any/all patients.	0
Absolutely Horrible. Will never recommend this doctor or place to anyone!	0
The receptionists were as rude as one can get. I arrived early for my appointment and then waited for 90 minutes before I was seen.	0
horrible experience. took forever, and when i was finally seen it was as if i was at a fast food chain putting in an order. so quick, and impersonal. never going back here again.	0
Very odd doctor and bad office with mean front staff	0
This was such a horrible doctors visit! I felt like I was just a number that they were trying to get in and out. The staff there was very unpersonable.	0
He never comes on time. Very unprofessional. Nowadays doctors charge late fee when patients come late...but there is no latw charge for doctors coming late?	0
I am very disappointed with my experience with this office for a number of reasons. Unhappy with the service don’t feel my best interest was in mind. Won’t return.	0
I have seen doctor chuey multiple times for my primary care needs. he has been adequate for certain things but visits always felt rushed and very impersonal with him. He not very engaged with me as his client. and when I needed him most to help me seek out treatments for mental health he refused to assist me. I will never seek his services again.	0
Unprofessional, uncaring and rude.	0
Upsetting when a doctor does not listen to his patient to try and understand where they are coming from or what they are saying. I will never recommend him, he is just pompous and arrogant!	0
I didnt like the doctor's attitude towards me, he had an angry tone for coming to see him for such an issue -- never happened to me before.	0
Dissapointing. The office denied they took my healthcare, though the provider had a signed contract that they did. After the office agreed they took my provider they denied they took my provider when I arrived. The front desk looks miserable btw.	0
Dr. Chuey exhibited intellectually dishonest behavior which is the reason for my poor rating. He also billed my routine yearly physical preventive care lab tests as uncovered outpatient services, conversely to what he said would happen.	0
I've been going to him for years and years.	1
Don’t make an appointment if you don’t have all day to wait. That’s all I’ll say.	0
Very negative experience. She had zero bedside manner and seemed very condescending. Bizarre experience overall and my most negative medical experience to date.	0
Avoid this office. Dr. Yolanda is not familiar with the new guidelines and is not willing to advocate for her patient.	0
She didn’t help me answer the questions I went to visit for, rushed and asked me to leave because she has other patients to see. Super disappointed!	0
Unfortunately the doctor wasn’t very knowledgeable or helpful. The wait wasn’t horribly long but the overall experience seemed rushed.	0
I would not recommend anyone to see Dr Bekhor. My experience over the last two years has been extremely frustrating and I've now found another PCP. I feel that he is very quick to jump to conclusions and doesn't take the time to listen to me as his patient. His office staff has also been frustrating to work with. Having Dr. Bekhor as a PCP has been a very negative experience for me.	0
With all due respect, Dr. Silvera is a horrible doctor.	0
Dr. Silvera was harsh, rude, and clearly planned to spend no time on my case. I will NOT be going back to him.	0
I was not please with her as a physician, my first visit with her was good my second was horrible. i would not recommend her at all. she isnt concerned with patient care and she doesnt answer direct questions about your health, she would rather refer you to someone else just to get a return visit or to be done with you quickly	0
Dr Rice is one of the worst doctors I've ever seen. I felt like I was rushed out of the office. I would never recommend anyone to see her.	0
So inconsiderate and unprofessional! Not seeing Dr. Rice again.	0
This was the worst appointment I've ever had. 1) Wait time -- unreasonably long. I had an appointment and they are switching over all of their intake systems. Unfriendly and excessive wait times. I will never return.	0
I hate to say but the office staff is incredibly unprofessional.	0
I've been coming to Beth Israel for two years and the way the front desk always treats me is very rude and always makes you fill out the same exact form as if you've never been there before.	0
No compassion or sympathy. Rushed and did not help at all. Maybe she was having a bad day. But I won't be back.	0
Highly unsatisfied with my visit to this doctor. Long wait, brief visit. They also make you come back a second time to pick up your blood test results. Rude receptionists. Will definitely not come back.	0
I felt rushed during my time there with this doctor. I had asked a few questions on what I was diagnosed with, and her answers were vague, and unclear. I left the place shaken up, and upset. I went to see another doctor, who explained everything in detail to me, which cleared up the uncomfortable feeling I had after seeing Dr Rice.	0
Dr. Rice has horrible bedside manner and I'm not sure why she is a doctor- no sympathy, rushed appointments, and no thoughtful consideration.	0
"The doctor was not sensitive to my concerns and said ""ew"" about a a rash I had which cannot be anything they haven't seen before. Front desk staff are very abrupt. Will not go here again."	0
I was waiting there for an hour when there was no wait time, but no one seemed to know what happened. If that is how this office works, I will never recommend.	0
I was disappointed with Dr. Rice’s bedside manner.	0
I don't appreciate doctors that quickly dismiss every concern a patient has just because the patient looked young and healthy. Very unhelpful and dissatisfactory.	0
The two receptionist at the front desk were very unprofessional. They were both very rude.	0
The office staff is disorganized. It is hard to get them to return calls or send faxes. For that reason, I won't be returning.	0
I was there for an hour and a half, and maybe about five minutes of that time was actually spent with the doctor. The rest o the time, I was just waiting. Altogether, frustrating and a huge waste of my time.	0
Reception team is very rude and unprofessional. Drawing blood took 3 attempts- painful. Wish Dr. Rice would spend more than 3 minutes with me, I had questions left unanswered. This I not the first time either.	0
She was cold, uninformative. I went to her on a follow-up after being in the hospital and she seemed inattentive and in a rush to get me out of there and in no mood for questions.	0
Waste of my time	0
The receptionists were very rude.	0
Worst receptionists ever	0
Don’t go to this office!! Wait is awful !!	0
When ever necessary	1
Bad/slow follow up	0
The wait time was so HORRIBLE and UNPROFESSIONAL.	0
He was careless and not professional	0
"Did not let me speak the whole time, interrupted me when I did try to speak to explain what was going on with me, I actually had to stop him and say ""Can I please speak now?"" he disregarded everything I said and even took a phone call in his office in front of me with another doctor complaining about another patient! He completely disregarded my concerns and made me leave the office feeling foolish. I will never go back nor will I recommend him."	0
I’d avoid seeing this doctor and his practice.	0
Didn't care about my symptoms, refused to prescribe basic medications unless I routinely visited him and gave blood samples.	0
Arrogant know it all, doesn't even let you get the words out.	0
The only good thing about my visit with Dr. Smith was how pleasant the office team is. Otherwise I was very disappointed with him and his service. I would not recommend him.	0
Weird vibe in this office and they tried to sell me a concierge doctor service outside of my insurance. Will not go back.	0
Be aware you need to pay an out of pocket high fee a year to see her and it's not included in your deductible. The fee is completely out of pocket just to be her patient. I felt like the staff/doctor's assistant was very aggressive in selling me the concierge program. It was a super weird and uncomfortable feeling.	0
I only went to this Dr because I needed a prescription for an upcoming trip. He was incredibly rude, and had an awful manner.	0
Lazy and unprofessional;; within a minute of meeting he was arguing with me. So aggressive and dismissive. Don’t waste your time	0
He was always late the two times i did see him. His staff was also horrible in helping out. They were lazy and did not want to help get me referrals when I needed it. The doctor was also dismissive of what my needs were to begin with.	0
In My 47 years of life, this was the worst experience ever encountered.	0
Horrible! Incredibly unprofessional. It seems that this doctor is more concerned about money than he is helping his patients. Crazy experience. DO NOT RECOMMEND.	0
His office smelled bad, and was very Chaotic. his bed side manner was horrible and he didn't listen.	0
This office is the absolute worst.	0
Never again. Doesn’t call you back after at least 5 calls to him. No care in the world.	0
Terrible! I waited nearly 2 hours only to be told they didn't have the shot i needed. Very rude! never again!!	0
Money hungry! All he wanted to do was perform unecesssry tests. Good thing I got a second opinion.	0
This was the most unprofessional experience I’ve ever had with a medical office.	0
Absolutely horrible service and very unprofessional. Never again, what a joke of a doctor's office.	0
Horrible! She was rude and completely uneducated. I would NEVER go back to her again! Worst experience, very unprofessional and has an attitude problem.	0
If she was so concerned with getting home sooner, she shouldn’t be practicing, she should retire. Never seeing again.	0
Beware - this office double books all of their appointments so you could be waiting for quite some time.	0
Absolutely terrible! The doctor was 45 minutes late for my appointment in which she didn't even acknowledge nor apologize for. This was an incredibly uncomfortable and infuriating experience.	0
She was horrible and a bully. I wouldn't go back to her for anything. I call her the witch. She dismissed everything I KNEW was wrong because I'm young. Awful.	0
I would never recommend this doctor to anybody and will never return.	0
Horrible bedside manner. After shaming me for not getting as much exercise as I should and telling me 7-8 hours of sleep is too much (the CDC recommends 7-8 hours for adults), she insulted my former physicians assistant who has known me since I was 11 pretty much for just being a physicians assistant.	0
The front desk lady is absolutely nasty. Rude and aggressive. The doctor herself is not very personable or friendly. Very soviet mentality, cold and calculated.	0
They didnt want to take my preventive care and wanted to charge me. After a long call with my insurance they decided to accept it but wouldn't do any of the lab exams, which I had to go to a lab later to get them done. Also, after she got my exam results, I've never heard from them. Just overall a very unprofessional experience.	0
Very rude and alarmist for no reason.	0
Service is bad. they lost my blood test and I needed to come again. I did the blood test to check specific things and they didn’t check for that.	0
Avoid.	0
I’ve never had such a terrible and unsatisfactory doctors visit of any type that was so bad that I needed to go back and ask for a refund.	0
If you're visiting him for primary care in hopes for a diagnosis here is what you need to know: Not relatable. Not thourough. Doesn't listen.	0
Absurdly messy and unprofessional office environment. Dirty and disorganized. Scary	0
Never going back to see this nut job!	0
Never before have I felt so neglected by a doctor. So here I am with an untreated condition, and I will NEVER see this doctor again due to the unprofessionalism of his staff.	0
DANGEROUSLY INCOMPOTENT!!!	0
Terrible doctor!!! Would not recommend. Office dirty and did not follow up on my result.	0
Horrible offices: old , dark, very small, almost depressing - The doctor spent time with me and was nice but was not very attentive: while I mentioned very clearly thta I have strong pain, I had to run after him at teh end to have a pain medicine. - Did not feel very reassured after the consultation.	0
He was very distracted. Did not listen well. And the physical exam was less than adequate. I did not have a good experience with him.	0
Dismissive and didn’t explain much. Not very helpful.	0
He had very poor beside manner. He said something very insensitive. He didn’t even listen. I will not be going back.	0
Doctor was inattentive and not involved. No prescription, no diagnosis, no referral for tests and no relief for my issue. I need to book another appointment with other provider to finally solve the issue.	0
Dr. Crespin has sub par bedside manner and often will not explain something unless you as him to. There are a number of occasions where his office was supposed to call me back and they did not. I would not recommend him to anyone.	0
He had me do a colonoscopy before a blood test which was bizzare. He also still has no idea what is wrong with me and doesn’t seem to care.	0
The doctor is kinda rude and didn't pay attention to me - he was texting while talking to me, and even made calls. I had to repeat myself several time because he was texting someone. The worst is.. he didn't tell what is wrong with my stomach and gave me medicines without doing any checks on me... I felt confused.	0
seemed unprofessional, did not listen to my concerns.	0
Extremely awkward bedside manner and did not provide much feedback or advice for treatment. Would not return.	0
This appointment was rushed and the examination was poor. He asked me basic questions, told me take probiotics and that was it. I had to ask him to draw blood and have a blood test done - I was still in so much pain the next couple of days that I had to see a different doctor, who diagnosed me with a stomach virus, prescribed me medication and now i'm better. I wouldn't recommend this doctor.	0
This office is very dirty and cluttered which I found unprofessional	0
Would never go back again, very sales-y. No detail discussions on my report, only recommended me to do more tests with other docs.	0
The wait time is always more than an hour. The office is very disorganized and crowded with people who are not patients but also don't seem to be working there. The actual services are fine and comprehensive but not worth the wait and inconvenience at every visit.	0
If I could leave 0 stars I would. I was highly disappointed by my visit with Dr. Chakote. He spent at max 2 minutes in the room with me, after I waited for 50. Didn’t ask any questions to get to know me or my medical background, and couldn’t be any more disinterested in me as a patient. I had to remind him twice why I was even there, and he didn’t offer any solutions. His office staff wasn’t any better. I thought people became doctors because they wanted to help other people, but that clearly wasn’t Dr. Chakote’s motive. Save yourself the time and find another PCP.	0
This was the worst visit I have ever had with a doctor! He did not even look at me ... first he didn’t have the decent bedside manner to greet me ... then he didn’t make an attempt to assess me .. I’msteaf just wrote up referrals .. for the simpliest things that he could’ve taken care of .. he literally referred me to DOH for vaccine.., worst .. the wait was long and none of my objectives and concerns were addressed !!!! Waste of time and money !!!	0
"The doctor was very, very, very unprofessional, and the nurse had no idea how to draw blood. I called in after I noticed very large bruise starting to form. To quote a text message from this practice: ""You don't go to office and thenyou keep texting me wkend when I am not your MD"" Would you want to receive this text from your doctor? Does the above even make sense to you? If you answered no, stay away."	0
He did not have a friendly bedside manner at all and wouldn’t recommend. The office was also very dirty.	0
Seemed unsure of diagnosis. Incorrectly charged me for my visit. Phones were down at the office for months. Bed side manner was atrocious.	0
The doctor's bedside manners were atrocious. He didn't introduce himself or communicate what he was going to do during the appointment, he just out right did it. There was zero professionalism at this office.	0
I felt like an inconvenience to the Dr. I would never recommend anyone go here.	0
He was awful, horrible bedside manner and he barely even looked at me while he was asking me questions. I will not be returning.	0
